My idea is something like... Since we as children watched professional wrestling growing up and saw the wrestlers selling shots and generally giving into each other's attacks for the most part. There is no real fight there. Not saying there isn't contact. But i mean, the idea that they let each other pull moves on each other.    From watching this, we grow up having childish ideas and beliefs about how a fight will go down. 

Do you think professional wrestling creates poor fight IQ? lol. I know that sounds drastic but, im just sort of curious. I am not stating any facts here.

K.O'd a double digit number of times. 

40 years old. 

First pro fight was in 1999.

Over 60 MMA fights. 

And he's still 4-1 in his last 5(arguably 5-0) in the UFC.  

He should be like Chuck or BJ Penn at this point where normal people can K.O him because his whole head is a off switch, but he's still beating top competition. 

I get that repeated blows to the head is worse than getting one-punched K.O'd, so Iron chinned guys have more CTE than a guy like him probably, but how did the Francis Uppercut not end his career when HW with the worst chin got clean uppercutted by the HW with the most power?

For now I'm only going over the men's divisions. Open to anyone disagreeing with these picks:

Figgy vs DJ @125 lbs

I think DJ takes this. He's a stronger wrestler than Moreno, and I think he would have a shot at taking Figgy down while evading the big punches. 

Petyr Yan vs Dominick Cruz @ 135lbs

I honestly think Yan could have trouble with finding Cruz's chin at the start of the fight, seeing as how Aldo had success with head movement in the early going. However, yan's pressure and more technical boxing leads me to believe Cruz would get finished late in the fight.

Volkanovski vs Jose Aldo @ 145 lbs 

Volk outworks any version of Aldo, sorry guys. And I'm a huge Aldo fan 

Khabib vs Khabib @ 155 lbs

I don't know if Khabib would be able to take down and control Khabib due to Khabib's sambo background. Hard to say 

Kamaru Usman vs Georges St Pierre @ 170 lbs

Ok, an interesting one. St Pierre has had trouble with southpaws who smother his jab and can stop his takedown. However, while Hendricks and Kamaru have similar wrestling accomplishments, Hendricks is the better inside boxer and had a much more active lead hand than Usman has. That said, Usman is more physical than Hendricks. Ultimately, I see a prime GSP and Usman getting into a striking battle as both have excellent tdd.  GSP wins a boring decision, but is not impressed with his own performance.

Israel Adesanya vs Anderson Silva @ 185 lbs

This already sort of happened, and while people here on reddit say Adesanya wasn't trying because Silva is his hero I personally saw Israel throw several full power headkicks that got dodged. Prime Silva vs Adesanya goes down as a sort of boring but occasionally flashy striking match that Silva wins by controversial decision, idk

Jan vs Jon Jones 

Jan is at his core a blitzing kickboxer who usually comes in on strait lines. Jones ate up most of the guys who fought that way against him: Rampage, Machida, Vitor. Prime Jon Jones kicks the shit out of him and maybe takes him down and submits him. 

Stipe vs Fedor

Maybe my dream fight.  This would be a crazy banger. I am not convinced that Stipe would not get knocked out after a clinch exchange -- Fedor would throw nasty hooks after exiting the clinch like DC and we've seen what that can do. On the other hand, Stipe has cleaner boxing that Fedor and more effective head movement. He might be able to evade Fedors wild swings. On the ground Fedor has a good chance of getting a submission from either top or bottom; I don't think we've seen Stipe do anything but hold people down and ground and pound, while Fedor has submitted high level grapplers. Fedor by submission or KO, but definitely takes some hard shots along the way.

Well, that's it for me. Any thoughts",Current UFC champs vs the GOAT of their division,501,1

I finished it last night and really enjoyed it. Thought the story line was pretty compelling and that the acting was, across the board, not at all bad. Frank Grillo is great,as we're Nate and Jay. Was the drug taking too overboard or is there a niche of fighters that indulge to that degree? In my (unlearned) opinion the majority of fighters come across as way too disciplined to be this indulgent. At least at fight time.

Also the female characters were well portrayed and complex, not at all one dimensional, you know, like real women? 

My main complaint would be that characters would build up as compelling and interesting, just to disappear and not be seen again.

It's just my personal preference to how I would choose the P4P#1, and I'm wondering if anyone else does the same.  


I guess I'll put it out there and say that I think Khabib is the P4P#1. I see alot of posts on here and r/ufc that weights the P4P#1 discussion on their record e.g. number of title defences. I picked Khabib based more on how he wins over what he's won. The way I see it, either the opponent surrenders (W by submission) or he comes out of fights completely unscathed and his opponents appear to pose almost zero threat of any danger throughout the fight. To me, this is the very definition of ""winning a fight"".   


While it can be debated whether Jones beat Reyes, Santos, Gustaffson 1 or even Cormier 1, possibly the only debatable victory in Khabib's career is against Iaquinta. While people argue whether fighter X won fight Y, the most viable argument involving Khabib (aside from this GOAT argument) is whether Conor really won round 3.   


In summary, if I was forced with a gun to my head to bet money on a fight, it'd put it on a Khabib fight. Because of that, he's the P4P#1 for me.",Anyone here prefer a more qualitative than quantitative metric for the P4P#1 discussion?,36,1

His only losses would be a decision loss to MACHIDA at openweight, 2x GOAT WW, 1x MATT HUGHES and 1x Jens Pulver at the 4th fight of his career.

&gt;Khabib never faced this kind of opposition. He never attempted to grab the welterweight belt 3 times, he never fought openweight against a future lhw champion and he never fought a ufc champion on his 4th career fight. If he did, there’s no way in hell he would be undefeated.

&gt;I think khabib is amazing but there’s no denial that his record is waaay more padded than any of the other greats.

What do you guys think, is BJ way overlooked with the recency bias for Khabib. Personally I think Khabib is the LW GOAT but BJ's career till his 3rd title defence is really spectacular, he's the original BMF who started the trend of moving divisions, first actual Champ-Champ, What's your take?","What if BJ Penn had retired after his 3rd title defence, How different his legacy would've been?",0,0

I remember hearing his name in the documentary ""fightville"" which came out in 2011 talking about how he just signed to the UFC and looked promising. I was thinking in my mind about fighters who are both very experienced and at the peak of their career. This is a strange metric, and experience is kind of hard to measure, how do I weight total number of fights vs the level of competitions of those fights vs the results of those fights. I think this is more of a subjective metric and I'm sure many of you will have different ways in which you view it.

I know there are more experienced fighters out there, namely Edgar, Sanchez, Jones, Ferguson, Guida, Miller, Cerrone, Arlovski, Pettis etc but I think with the exception of possibly Jones most people would definitely say the others are over the hill. I personally do feel Jones is past his prime but I would understand someone arguing against that, and if that's the case than he would certainly be a counter example to my claim. RDA is another fighter who is more experienced that someone could argue is still in their prime, but honestly I think that one is a stretch.

The only two fighters that seem to stand up to  him in this very informal metric in my mind are Jorge Masvidal and Charles Olivera. Although I wouldn't be surprised if Jorge is on the down swing now and I'm not entirely sure the level of competition Olivera has faced would quite be enough to rival Dustin, although it is extremely close.",Is Poirier the most experienced UFC fighter still in his prime?,199,1

Mine in no particular order:


UFC 100: The first event I ever watched. Introduced me to the sport of MMA so I'll always view this event fondly. A dominant performance that I was impressed by from GSP. One of the most brutal KOs in UFC history delivered to Bisping from Dan Henderson. Lesnar defeating Mir and then going on a classic rant afterwards. After this I was hooked.


UFC 189: A main event filled with finishes. Mcdonald vs Lawler II. One of the greatest fights in history. McGregor and Mendes, lived up to the hype.


UFC 217: Probably my personal favourite ever UFC event. Wonderboy putting a clinic on Masvidal. Rose upset over Joanna. Garbrandt and Dillashaw fight was exciting from start to finish. The return of GSP. Me and my friends watching this were still buzzing about it hours after it had finished.


UFC 199: Great night of fights. Poirier KO over Bobby Green. Old man Hendo getting a win. Holloway vs Lamas was a banger. Cruz vs Faber III to finish out their trilogy. Bisping upsetting Rockhold. An incredible event.


UFC 2020: Maybe a strange choice but I really enjoyed this event. Kattar vs Burgos was a great fight. Watching DC defeat Volkan and Stipe against Ngannou were two fights I also enjoyed.",What's your top 5 favourite UFC events?,18,1

I am 22 and I feel like I need to start training now while I am in my physical prime if I ever want a chance to be a serious contender in an organization like the UFC. I am already exercising and training myself 8-10 hours a day and have made leaps and bounds. I am ready to take it to the next level and DM a fighter and ask them to train, and to maybe network to see if they can get me an in at the UFC. I am 5'8 and currently a heavyweight but I am approaching 205 and even think I can hit middleweight if I start to take my diet seriously. I've been hitting the pads and would say my boxing is a 65/100, nothing special but definitely decent and I have more potential. My wrestling is a 53/100. I have never done BJJ but since I know alot from watching UFC all the time I think my BJJ is at least a 30/100 because I know all the chocks already, I just have to practice them. 

Aside from networking with current fighters and asking them to teach me what else should I be doing to help me get to the UFC?",Help me get to the UFC,30,1

The winner of Dustin/Conor? Or the winner of Chandler/Hooker (this makes the most sense to me personally). Not exactly sure where Olivera lands right now, although realistically he deserves a shot at the belt.

If Conor wins I can very much see the UFC pushing him vs Garth for the title as the two have a small history and that's mostly seen as a favorable matchup for Conor.

I noticed something, Conner kept a good distance from Dustin by using kicks but in the ending sequence, Dustin is def feeling wobbled from a left, but before he goes down he blocks an incoming left with his hands but he gets dropped? Like how??  


Also, if you watch closely (i had to slow it down to see it) Conners first hit is to the back of the ear when dustin drops, but his second hit, the one that knocks him out, is clearly on the back of the head. Just square to the back of the head.  


I feel, Dustin going down like that and not protecting himself after the first hit def spelled the end for him, but getting knocked out from a blow to the back of the head gives him no possibility to roll and defend. I don't think it would have happened, but it could have.

Frankie has 27 UFC fights and 9 of those are title fights, has wins over BJ 3 times, Cub twice, Yair, Faber, Mendes, Charles Oliveria, Sean Sherk (Only losses prior to the Edgar one were to BJ, GSP &amp; Hughes) Jim Miller, Tyson Griffin, Maynard (in possibly the best trilogy in UFC history) and many more. IMO what hurts Frankies resume is the amount of rematches he has been in Maynard, Henderson, BJ, Aldo, and Swanson yet never getting the chance to fight Pettis, Cowboy, or Gilbert. 1 thing with Frankie that amazes me is how he was able to keep himself in title contention for so long in multiple weight classes 3 title shots at FW and 2 at LW.

Down Below, I will list two all-time greats that do not receive nearly enough attention today.

1)Randy Couture:

Randy""The Natural"" Couture was not mentioned last August while discussing the greatest UFC heavyweights ever. Couture may be forgotten because he was never the biggest personality or had the most exciting fight style, but boy could he fight. With wins over Vitor, Pedro Rizzo, Chuck Lidell, Mark Coleman, and Gabriel Gonzaga. As well as dethroning Tim Sylvia and becoming the oldest champion ever at 43. Not bad for an old man? Not to mention he was the first-ever champion in two weight classes. Randy's legacy is not only from fighting but also from coaching and being a gym owner. He helped found TeamQuest, which has produced elite talents such as Dan Henderson and Chael Sonnen. As well as his Xtreme Couture gyms. To all the newer fans who are not familiar with Captain America, please do yourself a favour and watch some past fights.

2) BJ Penn:

BJ had one of the worst downfalls out of any fighter. With a record of 16-14, new fans may see a row of losses on his record. However, that should not distract you from just how great ""The Prodigy"" was in his prime. Most of those losses came from Bj continuing to fight despite retiring multiple times. Had he stayed retired when he originally planned, after the Matt Hughes trilogy fight, he would have had a respectable record of 16-4-1. He had amazing wins over Caol Uno, Sean Sherk, Joe Stevenson, Kenflo, Diego Sanchez, and becoming the welterweight champion by submitting a prime Matt Hughes. Even in defeat, Penn had an ultra-competitive fight with GSP and Frankie Edgar (X2). Don't let the record fool you. Bj was one of the very best the sport has seen and put on some great fights for the fans.

Conor only has two fights at 155 in the UFC and neither gauge his gas tank very well. His Eddie fight was a 8 minute masterclass and against Khabib he got dominated for the majority of the fight and nearly finished in the 2nd. Khabib gassed out Dustin and Gaethje as well similar to how Conor got gassed from the beating. I bring this up bc most people are acting like Conor will lose to Dustin if it goes outside of 2 or 3 rounds. Which also  Dustin was very gassed in the Hooker fight in the championship rounds. 


What I’m getting to is that I’m not sure if Conors stamina will be an issue at 155. Is there any other reason besides the Diaz and Khabib fights that would make his stamina a concern? Seriously wondering",Is Conors gas tank bad at 155?,75,1

Out if the 3,227 fighters to have ever graced the UFC Octagon, only 108 have reached the 20+ milestone, so only about 3%

This is an accomplishment in of itself, but out of those 108 fighters less than 10 have been able to maintain a ""C Average"" in terms of winning percentage. 

#By Winning Percentage:

* GSP = 91%
* Jones = 90%
* DJ = 80%
* Cormier = 80%
* Benson = 80%
* Aldo = 76%
* Max = 75%
* Lewis = 75%
* Bisping = 70%


If Maia &amp; Cerrone win their next fight he'll be ahead of Bisping as well. There are probably more, but those were the obvious ones I saw at first glance.

Anyhow, less than 10 fighters have a passing grade in term of winning percentage. It's just too damn hard to compete 20+ times at the highest level and come away with a ""C Average""",Here are possibly the most impressive winning percentages in the history of the UFC/Zuffa!,127,1

I'm an older guy (late 30s) who just trains for fun and a little excercies, I am a novice and not the most fit person around but I enjoy it!

I have been going to my local on and off for a few months, but I have issues with cardio and fatigue, especially with grappling / wrestling.

I am can just about survive  music thai sparing but when we are grappling, if I defend or attempt 3 or 4 takedowns (after mitt class and warm up etc) it pretty much tuckers me out and my body is dead for the next 24 hours ;)

Anyway, I am moving soon and wondering before I start a new gym, what would be the best way to improve my conditioning for grappling at home?

I will be buying a spin bike and doing some jogging for cardio but would looking something to help with wrestling fatigue, and prefable something with body weight or cheap items (bands / small weights) which are not expensive.

All advice appreciated!",[noob] wrestling fatigue,37,1

Chad only lost to champs and Frankie only lost his title fights + the Ortega &amp; Zombie fights at FW.

Not established talent like Jan or Reyes, or stars from other divisions, like Jon and Izzy. But people who are in the lower end of the top 5 to 15th that haven’t had a chance to prove themselves.

What he did in MMA was absolutely incredible. Watching him do the things he did in 2006-2012 was exactly like watching Michael Jordan play basketball. I’m not in any way challenging his greatness. 
However, I strongly believe that José Aldo was even greater than Anderson.

First, let’s compare their resumes when they were in their prime:  
Silva had wins against: Franklin 2x, Sonnen 2x, Henderson, Belfort, Griffin, Lutter, Marquardt, Bonnar, Okami, Maia, Irvin, Cote, Leites.  
Aldo had wins against: Edgar 2x, Mendes 2x, Faber, Brown, Sung-Jung, Florian, Hominick, Lamas, Swanson, and Gamburyan.  
Silva and Aldo both had 11 title fight wins. I just think Aldo’s competition was definitely tougher. Edgar was a Lightweight champ and one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world (as well as being one of the all time greats), Brown was the #1 Bantamweight in the world when Aldo beat him, Faber was the #1 BW before he lost to brown. And although Mendes, Sung-Jung, Florian, Hominick, and Lamas were not champs — they were **extremely** high level fighters. Although people probably aren’t familiar with Gamburyan, he had wins over Brown and Leonard Garcia.  
Although Aldo’s wins didn’t have the shock value of Silva’s — Aldo was just as dominant as Silva, and Aldo did so against better competition. The only fights where he didn’t win dominantly/decisively were against Florian and Mendes. He never faced adversity the way Silva did in the fight with Chael.  
Another huge aspect that I never hear people talk about is the fact that Aldo is **still** one of the best pound for pound fighters in the world. In 2019 Aldo was ranked as the #1 contender. That was ten years after his reign started. That is absolutely insane.  
He also has never lost a fight against someone that was not the Champ or the #1 contender at the time he fought them … AND he has never been dominated in any of those losses, unless you consider his loss to Conor as being dominated (I personally don’t think so, but I understand the argument). People also forget that despite his current losses, Aldo destroyed Stephens and Moicano. 

Again, I’m not trying to take anything away from Silva. I’m writing this post because I think Aldo is the single most under appreciated fighter ever, and in my opinion, he is without question one of the 5 Greatest Fighters of all time.",Am I wrong for believing that Aldo is ahead of Silva on the list of all time greats?,178,1

Only been consistently watching since 2018. I've been thinking of Holloway and Whittaker and how it seems as though they are poised to win against a good deal of top 10 guys. 

My question is - has there ever been a case where the number 1 contender held up title fights simply by shutting down a bunch of top 10 guys? Or, at least retained that #1 spot over time. 

And I guess further, lets say the champ had won desisively enough that a rematch was not warranted. Has this occured where the number 1 guy or girl has gone on a tear without getting a title shot?

I guess it's just neat to think that there could be like 2 guys clearly topping the division. Not saying Holloway and Whittaker are those guys. But, especially in Holloway's case, a third matchup seems unlikely in the short to medium term. So, it would be cool to see him and Volk shut out those top 2 spots.",Dominant Number 1 Contenders,20,1

Firas is saying its not about intensity, its about accumulating the maximum amount of hours. So train less intense and do more work overall in the longterm.

From a weightlifting perspective, my understanding is in order to build muscle the best, you want to max out, go to failure. Often that means you need to rest that muscle group the next day.

Is Firas saying you would build more muscle over a 12 month period by not maxing, being fresher each day and doing more hours overall?

Another question with intensity training. In competitive sports, my understanding has always been one of the best ways to improve is making every practice maximum competitiveness/intensity.

One area i thought jordan was on the money, and i have observed this in so many sports GOATs over the years, every practice should be like you're playing a finals game 7. Desperate, maximum intensity.

and you want to verse the best competition you can find. And you grind that, out grind everyone else. So your practices you try and get more competitive than your matches, so when you get to the match, youre on a higher level.

Again, if im understanding Firas properly, is he saying this is the wrong way to do it? Firas is saying you drop the intensity and the competitivity? Which means you are in a flow state, and likely end up training more volume overall, and makes you better?

Excluded Koreans with foreign citizenship (Ex. Akiyama)

HW, LHW, MW and WW.

**HW:**

**Choi Mu-bae (The heavy tank of Busan)**

Greco-Roman Wrestling - 1990 Asian Games bronze medalist. Retired from wrestling after suffering a motorcycle accident.

Choi fought at PRIDE where he found some success. However he was only a middling fighter at best. Age (he made his debut at 34 years) and previous injuries ultimately caught up with him, and he retired after his last fight against Fujita Kazuyuki.

**Kim Min-soo(The Shark)**

Judo - 1996 Olympics silver medalist.

One of the fighters that I can't really hate, despite his less than stellar 3-7 record. He was already battered by the time he started MMA due to hardcore Olympian Judo training. Possibly the king of taking short-notice fights including that batshit crazy fight with Brock Lesnar, which he signed on a day's notice with a broken brow ridge (WTF).

**Choi Hong-man (The techno goliath)**

Folk Wrestling (Ssireum), Kyokushin Karate

Used to be a folk wrestling champion but went to K-1 after the organization in which he fought collapsed.

Possibly the most boring Ssireum wrestler ever. 

**LHW:**

**Jung Da-woon (Sseda)**

Boxing - Was an amateur boxer in his teenage years. Couldn't find his boxing record though.

**MW:**

**Park Jun-yong (The Iron Turtle)**

MMA trained from the beginning - Used to be an elite swimmer, quit due to abusive coaching and started MMA.

**Yoon Dong-sik**

Judo - 1994 Asian Games gold medalist, 47-fight win streak in various competitions.

Japan did what Japan does best (freak shows) for his career. He fought Sakuraba in his debut (WTF) at PRIDE. Less fight more execution, considering that fucked up interview where they was given Rampage (Yoon nearly Arm-bared Rampage in this fight though.) in his second fight.

**Yang Dong-yi**

Unknown, possibly wrestling.

**Lim Jae-seok (The Icepick)**

Kickboxing - KPW Lightweight tournament winner, Spirit MC middleweight champion. 

One of the very first MMA fighters in Korea. He fought at KPW, Neo-fight, Gimmie Five (김미파이브. This organization hosted its fights in a RESTAURANT! Yes, people could eat dinner and watch grown men tear each other apart in a ring at the same time! However, the whole thing was forced to shut down after a death in the ring. [https://news.joins.com/article/54648](https://news.joins.com/article/54648)), Spirit MC, etc. 

**WW:**

**Kim Dong-hyun (The Stun Gun)**

Judo - He is a Yongin University graduate (He purposefully went to Yongin Uni to receive MMA training)

Known to have competed in various local judo competitions, although I couldn't find his competition records. 

**Kim Dong-hyun (Maestro)**

Unknown, most likely MMA trained from the beginning.

Shares a name with Stun Gun. Usually referred to Ma Dong-hyun to avoid confusion, which actually happened at UFC Seoul.

**Lim Hyun-gyu (The Ace)**

Unknown, most likely MMA trained from the beginning.

For such a big guy (Chris Weidman sized guy at WW. LoL.), it didn't take much to beat him up. This is mostly due to him relying on his size to win fights.",Martial arts backgrounds of various Korean MMA fighters (Heavyweight~Welterweight),0,1

* place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
* write a haiku
* draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing or haiku are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

I initially thought one punch K.O’d would be more embarrassing, but I guess it really depends on who I’m fighting. If I’m fighting Francis, Yoel, Rumble, etc. it feels like whatever. If I’m a newbie then whatever. If I’m GM3 I’m a nobody and no one was watching anyway, so whatever. 

If I’m in the top 10 and get K.O’d by someone outside the top 10 like that I’m embarrassed. If I’m supposed to be a 10 year champ and GOAT contender and get put down down like that I’m embarrassed. 

On the flip I figured 5 round murder isn’t any better because that means he’s just straight up better than me, and I don’t like feeling like all that time I spent training was for nothing and realizing and I just might not be good enough to reach the top. These are the Hooker vs barboza, tony vs Justin, DC vs. Jon 1 type fights, stipe vs Francis, etc.

What do you think?

Edit:(I know everyone is going to say DC vs Jon is competitive, but it’s included because while it may be competitive to us the outcome is just plain embarrassing to DC. He had never lost a fight(might have been round at this point in his career), never been taken down, completed like 1/10 takedown attempts on Jon, and lost 49-46 UD. He lost all his bragging statistics to a single guy in one fight).",Which do you think is more soul crushing for a fighter to swallow after a loss?

I have no martial arts based equipment although I weight train daily. My knowledge of biomechanics and training protocol for MSK based stuff is high (my profession), but I know little to none about MMA training.  


Things I need:

  
\- High quality program resources for a beginner/solo. Preferably with progressions from someone who knows the sport.

\- Equipment that's worth investing in. So far all I've found is a double ended bag and wraps is worth it if that's all you ever buy.  


My goal: 

\- To be able to go to a gym and be ok at MMA style work post covid. I've done 2 BJJ classes and when I was really young did 3 years of karate which is the extent of my experience.

That means 5 rounds or a 3 rounder where it goes all the way or has  a late finish. I have 2 fights in mind. For 2018 the clear choice for me is Holloway vs Ortega. It looked like Holloway was practicing on the heavy bag and it was beautiful. For 2020 gaethje Ferguson. Now obviously gaethje was dropped but I believe it still counts as there were still 3 rounds out of 4 where geathje was really piecing up Ferguson.

I'm really curious to know if other MMA fans feel the same way as I do about Pound for Pound Rankings and the UFC's definition of the term ""Pound for Pound"". Out of the 15 fighters below, only 4 have fought in another weight class in the UFC (please correct me if I am wrong). With that being said, how accurate is the term of Pound for Pound? It seems to me the criteria the UFC uses to define Pound for Pound is how dominant a fighter is within their respected division and how significant the drop of in skill level and talent compared to the next best fighter within that division, which to me doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Want to know what ya'll think. 

&amp;#x200B;

Based on my definition of pound for pound, I believe Poirier is the best pound for pound fighter. You can argue McGregor as well considering he fought at 3 different weight classes which is extremely impressive given how uncommon that is, especially with fighters of his skill level. I would love to see Poirier go up to Welterweight for a few bouts because I really think he is more than capable of rattling off wins at that weight class as well. With that being, McGregor vs. Poirier II is going to be a spectacle with the 2 best pound for pound fighters (in my opinion) going toe to toe, can't wait! 

&amp;#x200B;

PLEASE NOTE: If there is a fighter on here that has fought in another weight class please correct me as I am going on memory. I also counted catch weight bouts towards whatever the weight class they were booked to fight at. For example if a fighter came in overweight at 159 for a lightweight bout, I considered it a lightweight bout. If I recall correctly, none of the fighters on here came in overweight, it was their opponent.

Phisically they seem to be fine, yeah they are slower because of the age, but they are not getting koed or dropped, their chins seem to be fine, but its like they lost their souls in that fight.

Old, doesn’t look like he even trains anymore, no serious coach, etc. I think he’s likely the worst active fighter on the roster at this point.

Semi obvious pick - Tyron Woodley: He’s clearly declined a ton, and is probably shot, but I’d like to see him against a rank 10ish guy to know for sure. He is about to turn 39 though and is coming off an injury, so I suspect he loses one more fight and gets cut in 2021.

Not obvious pick - Jorge Masvidal: He’s a 36 year old striker who doesn’t appear to keep himself in great shape, so his days of being a top guy are numbered. I think he could stick around and gatekeep and pick up wins here and there until he’s 40, but as a big draw I doubt he will. I think he loses to Colby in 4-5 months and then loses to Leon Edwards before retiring.

Not obvious at all pick - Stipe Miocic: Stipe is the GOAT UFC Heavyweight, but he’s also old and has taken some damage now. I don’t think he’s shot at all, but similar to Masvidal, I can’t see him sticking around into his 40s just to be a gatekeeper. I think he’s likely lost a step and gets caught and finished by Francis this year.

Max definitely won the first two rounds. If you wanna die on a hill about Max winning one of the final 3 rounds Go Head 

Max has benefitted from beating legends that are smaller than him like Aldo and Frankie Edgar. 

Calvin Kattar is the same height as Max and also has a longer reach and fast hands and combinations. I’m sure many of you have seen the stats. Max gets hit a lot. Zombie Ortega (not to be confused with Baldtega Kills Zombie Fanboys Jay Park) landed over 100 ‘significant strikes’ on Holloway. Even Ricardo Lamas, who everyone only ever posts that fight ending I Do Let U Bang Bro sequence, even he landed clean punches on Max. 

Though to be fair Max does roll with quite a few shots, and only Dustin Poirier has seriously rocked him at lightweight. In addition, fairly insignificant glancing leg kicks aka baby kicks Nick Diaz vs Carlos Condit are all counted as a significant strike as well. 

Volkanovski has a crispy jab and so does Kattar. The type of quick step in jab where you’re covering distance and punching at the same time. Volk is shorter but has a long reach. Poirier and Volk out struck Max for MANY MOMENTS read that right, more moments in more rounds. And they both had longer reach. 

Kattar is in prime position to beat Max Blessed Holloway. 

Charles Oliveira showed what these Hungry Long Time Contenders looking for their first title shot in their prime of their career. 

Aldo and Frankie dropped to 135 now. Lamas is retired. Max’s best 145 wins are of the past. 

**Biggest Question Mark: Does Calvin Kattar have a championship level gas tank and how much will Max kick vs Kattar be able to defend?** 

Not the most earth shattering performance vs Ige. Jeremy Stephens and Zabit showed Kattar is a slow starter of sorts. Calvin Kattar has the faster more power punches that he likes to throw in combination, dangerous finishing ability, Rhythm Changes (see how he did that little Tae Kwon Do style bounce bounce before launching a 1-2 to stun Burgos to start the TKO finish. He never did the whole fight until round 3. Kattar’s got looks). 

**Purely a hunch as a nobody with no inside info: Kattar rises to the occasion and looks great in rounds 4 and 5** 

Moicano kicked the shit out of Kattar. Max kicked a lot more vs Volk. I don’t have faith in Max moving away from a heavy boxing attack. Kattar has really really learned and improved after his defeats to Zabit and Moicano. This is going to be fight of the night. 

Old guard might be on the way out. **This fight very reminiscent of Charles/Tony. The former top guy not having to take the fight against the hot contender looking for their first title shot.** Established name known for long winning streak (extremely inflated, unranked fights mean nothing compared to a title fight or current top 10 opponent wins more significant).",Max Holloway vs Calvin Kattar Pro Kattar Preview Talk goes down in less than 12 hours!!!,7,1

*My take: Max Holloway has a small frame and would have difficulty putting on the weight to be a solid 155 lber. Additionally his volume striking would not be as effective in a weight class where the fighters will be able to eat more of his shots. Max while having an amazing chin would be challenged more at 155 imo despite him cutting less weight.

However, who are the best overall strikers in the UFC?

Max, certainly has a case, with his pressure, pace and arsenal of attacks.

Izzy is also up there as well.

Then he passed the weighting which was day before the bout. But during the remaining day he rehydrated and gained 7 kilos.

Referees have gotten so much shit from fans and been called morons by Dana white so many times, they are highly incentivized to let a fight continue way longer than they should.  

Corners stepping in for their fighters is very common in boxing, and it was common in the early days of MMA.  I can’t think of a single fight after the Pride / UFC merger that was stopped by the corner

Kattar vs Holloway should have been stopped by the corner between rounds 3 and 4, again between 4 and 5, and then after the first 30 seconds of round 5.  All the damage Kattar took in my opinion is completely the fault of his corner.  You cant expect a warrior to quit, and as I mentioned before the refs are just going to let your fighter take a beating now.  

There are loads of fighters who were known for their durability have their career completely derailed after beatings like that.  Wanderlei Silva after crocop knockout.  Barao after Dillashaw.  BJ Penn after Nick Diaz. Rory McDonald after Lawler.  The list goes on and on.

But in the back of my mind I couldn't help but think; how good is Volkanovsiki? 

Clearly Max hasn't lost a step, is washed up, or has taken too much damage and is suffering brain damage, He is still very much in his prime. And after steamrolling through the featherweight contenders; Swanson, Olivera, Stephens, Lamas, Pettis, Edgar, winning the title by beating one of the greatest featherweight (if not the greatest) in Jose Aldo twice, Volkanovski was able to stop him in his tracks twice, and after Max then displayed that performance against Kattar it proved that He wasn't losing any steps. Volkanovski it seems is something special. 

The thing is I am a huge Max fan, I believed He was going to beat Volkanovski going into both fights; even after losing the first, I hadn't lost hope, I thought He had a bad night but believed he was still the better fighter and was going to show everyone that by beating Volkanovski the second time around. But obviously the second fight made it even less clear who was truly better. 

Even though I love Max Holloway and am still a bigger fan of his than Volkanovski, I feel obligated to write this, even after the day Max had such a stellar performance, because I don't understand the hate and disrespect towards Volkanovski. Yeah, He beat a much loved fighter in Max, but so what? Its the fight game, it happens. Grow up. 

But for the first time in 8 years of being a fan of this great sport, I don't want to be a fan of a fighter, because of how their others fans are acting. Like people in the media got threats because of how they called their second fight, judges got threats, Volkanovski is constantly getting disrespected; and for the first time, I don't want to support a fighter I love because I don't want to associate myself as his fan because of how the rest act. Holloway fans are about to get on the same level of annoyance as McGregor fans now.  

I see his fans tweeting stuff like: 

""Watching the fight (Holloway v Kattar) Volkanovski probably wants to give up the belt so he doesn't have to fight Max again"" um why would he be scared to fight a guy who he's beaten 2x? That's the same level of idiocy as McGregor fans saying Khabib is scared and running away from a rematch when Khabib pretty much dominated him in the first fight. 

Or I see some shit like ""Holloway's the real champ""/""Volkanovski is a paper champ"".. umm again, sorry to burst your fictional world, but if you check the UFC website, Mr. Volkanovski has the belt over his shoulder. 

I guess what dumbfounds me the most is people who are so emotionally obsessed that they'd rather create their own fictional reality of what happened, rather than accepting the reality of what happened (Kind of reminds me of certain extremists of a political party). If you score their 2 fights (10 rounds) together by rounds (and yes, I know multiple fights aren't seen this way) it would either be 5 Rds - 5 Rds Draw or 6 - 4 for Volkanovski.

At the very least, Alexander Volkanovski is on the same level as Max Holloway. At best, He's shown himself to be a little better.  So I can't help but wonder, how good is Alexander Volkanovski. How was he able to stop the relentless pressure and continuous volume of Max Holloway? And unlike any other fighter who Max has fought in his prime (155 Dustin aside), who have all been overwhelmed and tired in the later rounds against Holloway while He himself increases output, how was Volkanovski able to turn the tables and do better against Holloway in the later rounds?",Just how good is Alexander Volkanovski?,298,1

A question I've had for god knows how long is that when a fighter is KO'd like full on slept no TKO, is it not unsafe to leave him on his back? My knowledge is that when you're unconscious, you are in danger of swallowing your tongue... So it confuses me as to why it just seems that the referee does nothing with the fighter? Am I misinformed? I don't doubt the medical credits of the UFC which is why I'm confused this doesn't happen, even in promotions like Pride I've seen a lot of the videos where the referee instantly takes out the fighters mouth guard, I don't even see that happen.

1- His bottom ground game. Specifically, Durinho mentions he tends to give the back when on the ground, that he panics and never likes to be on the bottom.

2- Walking backwards when standing, his defense is not good.

By making this post, I do know I am compromising my location and endangering myself, but this information will be helpful for those who end up in the same situation as me.

• Unbeknownst to the public, Dana White is a master detective and hunts down every lead he can take. I had an incident happen where I posted a meme on Twitter and he managed to recover metadata and triangulate my exact location. Get used to paying with cash. You have to keep a low profile at all times.

• You'll need to invest in a fast moving vehicle, at least one with average speeds of 80-100 MPH. Dana White is capable of running at speeds of 60 MPH.

• Keep a small, long pointy object with you at all times, like a stick. This will save your life in the event he manages to corner you, as you can jab him in the area between his neck and shoulders to knock him out for about 5 minutes. This will provide you with supple time to escape.

• Do not use bullets or tase. Bullets seem to bounce right off him and hit nearby pedestrians. A police officer once tased him after I made the mistake of notifying them and his roar disabled the power grid, killing at least 4 people in the nearby hospital. These were spun as the 2019 California power shutoffs by the media to prevent mass panic.

Please be careful.


EDIT: If anyone else has experience dealing with him, please share some tips. I am currently driving away from him at about 100 MPH and I'm not sure how long I'll be able to go, considering my gas tank is almost empty and I can still see h

EDIT 2: My vehicle has ran out of gas and Dana White is now walking towards me. I'm trying to hotwire this Ford I found, but I'm not sure I'll be able to do it in time. Please, if I do not make another update in 24 hours, I am presumed dead and I wish my search history be deleted by the authorities.

EDIT 3: I have managed to jab him in the neck and this bought me enough time to hotwire the car. I am now crossing a state border.

I find his movement, distance management and striking honestly second to none. At my gym we marvel at his precision and shot selection oddly enough we are affiliated with citi kickboxing (eugene bareman's gym) so we are quite striking focused. Enough about that..

I've noticed that in alot of interviews its like there is a concerted effort to change conors 'image' it's like each interviewer HAS to bring up conors covid help to the community and praise him for it. This is not to say it can't be praised it was great thing but I noticed the question or the way its brought up always is in the exact same manner - ""so conor, I know that you've done so many magical things for the community during the pandemic such as ..... and .... why did you feel that you needed to step up and help people with such a courageous act?"" . Which has me curious if ppl are told to bring this up to help his image problem as a bad boy

Second, conor has said multiple times in every interview I've seen actually that he WANTED to fight last year but felt like he was shelved. Kind of implying that Dana didn't want him to fight last year, I thought it was CONOR who was stopping conor from his so called fight season last year..but perhaps it was Dana due to covid and the amount of money conor brings in at the gate...

#1 of all time was what we just saw the other day. I have never seen ANYTHING like that. Max was completely in a flow state, that was in my opinion the best performance I've seen in the 2 years I've been watching. My mouth was agape the second and fourth rounds and I was hoping they'd stop it.

But I legit got scared SHITLESS and the hairs on my neck stood up and I got all wide eyed when Max got hype in the 5th.

My question is more about why the current best fighters aren’t getting the recognition they deserve, especially considering competition has never been more elite than it is now. 

Sorry if my question is confusing. But for example, why doesn’t anyone ever consider Volkanovski the GOAT when he already has a stacked resume and beat Max and Aldo who are considered the GOAT? Another example would be Usman, though this one will always be tough and still early to debate, why doesn’t anyone talk about Usman being the GOAT? What about Adesanya? Even on Izzy’s incredible run there are still many people who doubt him and hope for his downfall while everyone praised Silva as an untouchable god. 

Fans used to root for the champ, now it seems like people want to see the champ lose. 

I’d like to think maybe just not enough time has passed yet, but even as more time passes I still feel like the greatest fighters now will never get the same recognition as Aldo, GSP, Silva etc. 

What is it? Do we just hold a special place for the old generation of fighters because they were the first to be great?

Anik: 7 UFC knockout, but none bigger than this one, how do you feel?

Li: Oh I feel really good. Really good. Abu dhabi, I really like this place. Thank you to all the fans here today. Given the circumstances recently, having an audience makes us athletes so happy. Truly. The entire UFC, dana White, you guys are amazing. 

Anik: We are gonna take a look at the finish

Translator: Tell us what you think about the finish

Li: Oh I thought it was my cross. Before the fight, during, after, I kept telling people I was gonna KO him with my cross. He (ponzi) is really amazing. Everyone thought, including the broadcast (he makes a pun here cuz broadcast sounds like spinach in mandarin, so he called the broadcast- the spinach company), including a lot of people didn’t believe me. Only my coach, big bother Hu, Jason, my family who were supporting me. And my Chinese fans, they are watching me at 4 AM over there, thank you! Your support is my motivation. I love you!

Li: Today’s victory does not belong only to me. It belongs to my team, my family, my supporters, even the UFC. Without UFC, we wouldn’t have been able to compete, give everyone such good performances. Thank you to every staff who helped to make this happen, you all worked very hard. 

Li: Mr. Dana White. Please remember me! Remember me!

Anik: Congratulations. You set yourself up for a big one next!

**Post-fight**

John Morgan: Congratulations on a great performance tonight. How are you feeling about your performance?

Li: I feel really good. Every person after a win feels really good. Even if we were injured. We are all warriors, right? Even if I lost, it would have been ok. Enjoying the process is the most important. Win or lose. We always improve, learn.

John: You know in march, it felt like a big opportunity for you to kinda break through to the top of the division. It didn’t work out but I wonder if you took anything from the last performance that you were able to use tonight?

Li: Of course, you can’t succeed without failure. Failure taught me a lot. Every time I fail I learn a lot. You don’t always learn from winning. Last time I lost, it was due to jetlag. This time I came early to the states, then to Sacramento (training gym?/can’t hear what he said). 

John: Essentially cuz you were supposed to fight in December I wonder how that affected things. Was the positive or negative how did that affect things until now?

Li: Hmmm, these kinda things there isn’t good or bad. This kinda things, it is kinda fate. It’s also good things come to those who overcome challenges. For today, this was the best result we could have hoped for. 

John: Very nice. So highlight knockout, umm, and after you knocked him out it looked like you checked on him a little bit. What was going through your head? It almost looked like you felt bad for him

Li: Oh I know I knocked him out. I know he couldn’t fight back anymore so there was no need to attack him. If he were to have raised his guard I may have added a few punches but because he didn’t, he fell right back. If I were to still attack him then I would have lost my warrior’s honor, lost my honor as a human being. It’s unnecessary, we are just competing. 

John: Last thing for me. This is a huge huge win for you. Umm, what you feel like is next? I mean is there a name that makes sense or ranking? What’s next for you?

Li: Oh I think this is a job for Dana, up to the UFC’s desire. Is it really up to me who I call out I can fight? This is not important. What’s important is people got to see today’s performance. I am not here to just be around. I am gunning for the championship. It’s just I lacked an opportunity. 

Interviewer: Your card was the last card before the pandemic really hit. And then this fight is the first fight with the fans back. You haven’t had a fight without the fans there but did this fight feel any different at all from the last fight? Even though there were less fans?

Li: This is improvement right. I believe this covid we are gonna get through it soon. And in China, you know it’s the year of the OX. We have a saying the bull’s energy is going to go through the sky. Health in the year of the ox. I hope everyone is going to be health. Hope this pandemic will not interfere with our lives. I hope soon we can have lots of audience who can safely attend and watch us compete. And more fighters who can compete.","Li ""The Leech"" Jingliang UFC Fight Island 7 Post Fight Interviews Translated",114,1

On the UFC 25th anniversary in Denver 2018, KZ rushed in with his hands down with seconds left, Yair found an opening and won. As a korean american, I saw myself get knocked out. Doo ho choi already got finished by stephens in january of the same yr, now KZ got flatlined after he was up on the scorecards. 

The craziest knockout I've ever seen to this day, brutal loss for KZ. In his youtube channel, he explained that this was the turning point for him to train in the US instead of Korea. He came back with 2 first round finishes in 2019, one of them being vs Frankie Edgar in Busan, South Korea. An amazing moment in his home country, last fight to wrap up 2019, last fight with an audience since Saturday. Then Brian Ortega gets a title shot for beating KZ after a 2 yr layoff. 

Yair fought Stephens and won a UD after poking his eye in the first fight. He's currently #4 in the rankings above #5 KZ. I was hoping he would get finished by Stephens but Yair had a good performance. 

I would want KZ to fight Yair 2 if it means title shot, but I feel like he would get finished again. Idk why he just never has his hands up, even while rushing in. You would think he learned to not rush in hands down, yet he does it against Ortega and got hit with an elbow that pretty much ended the fight. 

KZ is 34, hes not a zombie anymore, hes human. Hes powerful and exciting not technical enough to hang with the top 4. With that being said, KZ stated wants to take a break after his Ortega and only fight 3 rds (which is why the Zabit fight fell through), but he'll be back. Calvin Kattar had a brutal loss, but he said he'll be back. I'm assuming each fighter is gonna fight at least once in 2021, book #5 Zombie vs #6 Kattar for a 3 rd fight after an extended break, probably post summer.",Why am I still salty about the Yair vs TKZ knockout?

I don't enjoy watching someone win by exploiting the rules, which is how I personally feel that Volk won the second Max fight - he was knocked down two or three times, but won because of the ""points"" he earned from smaller shots (like leg kicks) throughout the last 3 rounds. Same way I hate watching Harden score 35 points by driving into the lane, flailing his arms to draw fouls - yes, as the rules are currently enforced he is playing ""smart,"" but it doesn't feel like it's within the ""spirit of the game."" I want to watch fighters try to knockout or submit their opponent, not just stall and add up points - same reason someone like Usman drives me crazy.

I know Woodley gets a lot of guff around here, but watching him clobber Till then choke him out after all the bullshit was very satisfying in and of itself, but the icing on the cake was when Din Thomas gave him his black belt in the octagon after the fight - I got all choked up watching it again, it was such a beautiful moment.

I'm trying to get more involved in the depths of the sport, and part of that for me is going to be putting some small bets on fights to add a bit more fun/hype to them while also seeing how crap I am at predicting them. Probably no more than $15-30, but for me that's still a fair enough amount to part with that I'd like to find an actual good betting site or app.

Looking into Sportsbet, Bet365, and Neds, they all seem to be pretty brewed against the better. I'm sure a degree of that is unavoidable, but when it comes to banning big winners, making personalised odds against the things you like to bet for, and stuff like that is a pretty big turn off.

We would occasionally do takedown/takedown defense drills, but not frequent enough to really improve. (I know, it doesn’t make much sense but don’t ask me why Bc I don’t know lol) 

So I’m in a bit of a dilemma. My striking and ground game are both solid, but my takedown defense is literally dogshit. My default “takedown defense” is to jump guard and go for a guillotine because that’s pretty much my best shot. 

I want to work on this, but obviously because of covid I can’t be going to practice or looking for training partners, especially since my state is getting hit really hard by it. 

Is there a way to improve my takedown defense without a partner? Preferably one that isn’t just sprawling over and over and over because trust me I’ve been doing that lol. Any tips help, thanks!",How to improve takedown defense without a training partner?,25,1

My question is, is this because the fighter is genuinely trying to finish the fight and doesn't notice the opponent is out cold or is it a final chance to inflict more damage on the opponent they know is already out cold? Im sure there are exceptions, but im specifically talking about times when the opponent is clearly knocked out and the fight is about to get stopped.

If you want to do your own deep dive on the stats for the upcoming card, look no further. The site now features stats for the entire UFC 257 card - I hope you all enjoy!

 [https://natelatshaw.shinyapps.io/ufc\_fight\_night\_statistical\_companion/](https://natelatshaw.shinyapps.io/ufc_fight_night_statistical_companion/) 

This site contains a number of different tools located in separate tabs along the top. I'm still trying to build in new features, so if anyone has any ideas or feedback, please do reach out. I update the site after each card as well, so going forward, the site will essentially always display the upcoming UFC card.

First up, the ""Tale of the Tape"" tab allows users to select a bout and choose from over 100 statistics to instantly create a side-by-side statistical comparison between the two fighters. The available statistics include fighter attributes, historical fight outcomes, offensive/defensive striking stats, offensive/defensive grappling stats, and DraftKings/FanDuel fantasy stats. There's an absurd amount of possible combinations for this one - here is one example for the main event.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img 9pb0meahtlc61...*

Next, the ""Fight Outcome Probabilities"" tab features regularly updated 5Dimes lines and odds-implied win, finish, knockout, submission, and decision probabilities. Select probabilities with or without the vig, in addition to a number of other customization options. Here are the odds-implied fight outcome probabilities for the entire card presented on a single figure.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img ala4vbw0ulc61...*

The ""Daily Fantasy Sports"" (DFS) tab allows users to select a fighter to view his/her historical DFS performances, or select a bout and compare DFS performances between the two fighters across time. DraftKings, FanDuel, and PrizePicks points are all available. These figures are highly customizable as well. If you play DFS, this should be a great statistical research tool for you. Here's how McGregor performed on DraftKings over time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img vkud86dkulc61...*

The ""Fighter Careers Over Time"" tab allows users to select a fighter and view his/her UFC career along with one statistic of your choosing. There are a ton of options here, so this figure can be configured based on what you're interested in seeing. Here are Poirier's last 15 fights, as well as the number of significant strikes landed by him and his opponents, and the method of victory from each fight.

&amp;#x200B;

The ""Compare Fighter Careers Over Time"" tab allows users to select a bout and a statistic and then compare that statistic over time between the two fighters. Again, there are many parameters to play around with here to make this figure as informative as possible. Here are the striking differentials for Poirier and McGregor over time.

&amp;#x200B;

*Processing img sem6zb1uvlc61...*

Finally, the ""Compare Fighter Careers Scatterplot"" tab is the most flexible and extensive tool on the site. Choose a bout and one statistic for the horizontal axis and another statistic for the vertical axis in order to compare the two fighters along two dimensions. Scale and configure each statistic as desired and explore a number of other graphical parameters. The possibilities here are vast. Here are striking differentials against accuracy differentials for Poirier and McGregor.

&amp;#x200B;

To conclude, I built this site because I was having a hard time finding detailed stats for the UFC in a single place. With the existing sites, I often found myself clicking through several pages and then having to remember a bunch of numbers just to make a simple comparison between two fighters. My goal here is to streamline that process so users can (a) quickly and efficiently make many statistical comparisons and (b) have the ability perform their own deep dives on the stats that matter to them using a flexible set of visualization tools. Finally, if you find something interesting, each figure has a download button so feel free to share. Enjoy!",UFC 257: Poirier vs McGregor Statistical Companion,93,3

With UFC 257: Poirier vs McGregor 2 coming up, this is a good time to get familiar or re-familiarize yourself with [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/wiki/rules).

*To be clear:* if you want to participate in this subreddit it is on *you* to know what [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/wiki/rules) are, and abide by them. Pay special attention to:

[**1. Be Civil**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/wiki/rules#wiki_1._be_civil): A bit of banter is fine, but don't go too far. [Please do not spread salt](https://i.imgur.com/uYjpHHf.gif). We're all fans here. Wishing death or injury on a fighter is a bannable offense. Fighter bashing based on race, gender, religion, or sexual orientation is also bannable.

**This is the most common issue. We will remove uncivil arguments and *will* ban salt-spreaders.** 

[**3.4. Political and Religious discussions**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/wiki/rules#wiki_3.4._political_and_religious_discussions): Posts cannot be inherently political or religious, all posts and discussion threads must fit within the context of professional MMA discussion. **Comments which attempt to derail an existing on-topic conversation by turning it into a politically- or religiously-focused argument will be removed without notice and repetitive attacks will result in bans.** 

[**4. Spoilers**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/wiki/rules#wiki_4._spoilers): Spoilers are considered any images, videos or discussion threads which may reveal the outcome of a fight. This includes General Discussion. When creating a post, ensure the description (or title) does not reveal the result (i.e. finish, KO, scorecard, defends).

[**5. Duplicates**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/wiki/rules#wiki_5._duplicates): Before you post, check the /new queue to see whether it's already been posted. If an existing discussion is underway, add your post as a comment. This is to avoid ten gifs of one fight. Add your gif to the stickied 'Alternate Angles' comment in each fight thread.

[**6.2. Troll Posts and Troll Accounts**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/wiki/rules#wiki_6._low_quality_or_joke-only_posts): False announcements that fights are off or a fighter is injured will make us ban you. 

[**8. Other Suitable Thread**](https://www.reddit.com/r/mma/wiki/rules#wiki_8._other_suitable_thread): If there's a sticky about what you want to post, then don't create a separate post.

---
Other things that will get you banned:

* Wiki edits. They're not funny. 
* Again, fake news about fights/injuries. 
* Reposting a thread we've removed. 

If you're still unclear, feel free to ask here, in our daily General Discussion thread, or message the mod team.

---

Please don't take this as us trying to be power hungry and enforcing rules for no reason, we want everyone to be able to enjoy the fights (and shenanigans) and discuss them. We would also like to enjoy these events but its pretty hard when we're removing hundreds and hundreds of comments/posts that are simple violations. We would appreciate it if you'd help us out by sticking to the rules.

He’s a hell of a fighter and for sure tough as fuck, but I was watching the hooker fight a few hours ago and he just seems a bit sloppy compared to mcgregor.

I was thinking, maybe if dustin clinches with mcgregor and makes mcgregor carry his weight, he can drag him into the later rounds and get a TKO, but idk.

News flash, these guys put their lives on the line when they compete, extra eyes on the sport is a good thing for them. I’m sure Dustin can handle an interview with Stephen A. being a casual knowing he’s going to get countless followers and money from all the media hype around the fight.

Every popular sport has casual fans. Stop treating MMA like some secret society that only Zuffa-era fans get to enjoy. If you really respect these guys and the work they put in, you should be happy that the sport is blowing up and they’re getting more exposure (and more money). Why would you want to be stuck in the days where guys are broke and stuck fighting at 50 years old because they don’t have enough money to retire?

Ok so,

The guy clearly didn’t travel with Azaitar’s team which means he and his bag came into the country some other way. What kinda stuff can you not get on a plane with?

The bag wasn’t dropped at front desk to be brought up to Azaitar’s room but instead had to be Spider-Man’d in there. Which suggests they didn’t want any kind of trail of the bag getting there.

Someone on this card has in the past said some pretty heavily anti Islam shit. 

Azaitar was educated at a school with a sketchy history.

Everything written in this post is disputable and up for debate. The levels in MMA are as follows:

&amp;#x200B;

Champion - This spot is reserved for the top of the top, the crème de la crème, those who have had impressive win streaks before and after they won the title and displayed a level of dominance that is very rare and showed the world their complete superiority when it comes to fighting. Basically the biggest name in their respective divisions during their era. It has to be from the beginning of their careers to the end or up until this point in time and they shouldn't have huge blemishes on their records that stain their legacy such as a losing streak.

Examples: GSP, Khabib, Johnson

&amp;#x200B;

Elite - These are the fighters who are the top contenders in their division and can easily hold the belt if it wasn't for a very dominant champion that beat them. They have an incredible resume and are/were huge prospects that have a very good chance at achieving gold. They could also be titleholders that lost the belt to a champion level fighter. Few fighters reach this level.

Examples: Poirier, Whittaker, Hughes

&amp;#x200B;

Gatekeeper - The fighters that fall under this category are skillful fighters who, although talented, are clearly lacking in a certain area that allows a lot of opponents to hold wins over them. They definitely deserve to be ranked in their divisions, but they are always falling short when contending with the elites.

Examples: Barboza, Cowboy, Masvidal

&amp;#x200B;

Journeyman - These guys made it to the UFC but struggled from the get-go and have had trouble to even get ranked or stay ranked. They barely hold impressive wins against top opponents but they do get by through defeating each other and providing some degree of entertainment.

Examples: Perry, Herman, Lauzon

&amp;#x200B;

Cans - No potential, destroyed by everyone in the UFC if they even manage to get in. Most importantly, no wiki page.","""There are levels to this""",12,1

This is a stupid take on basically every level, but I chose to point out that he was far too small to compete in professional mma when he was young enough, as there were no smaller weight classes at the time. This person thought I meant he was too big, and posted this hilarious rant at me:

&amp;#x200B;

 

""I'm going to stop you right there, because it's clear you don't know what the fuck you're talking about.

&gt;There wasn't even a weight class for people his size when he was young enough to fight professionally

Actually *this* is a profoundly stupid statement. There were absolutely leagues all around the world where numerous dudes bigger than rogan made a living beating on other dudes who were bigger than rogan. He's 5'7"", 195 lbs. Let's not put him on a pedestal and act like he's not functionally scraping the manlet line.

Shooto, often considered the first organized MMA league, has a high cap of 265 Lbs for heavyweight - something Joe could easily meet. They've been televised since the mid-80s. Pride, considered by many to be the most mature precursor to the UFC has never had a weight cap for HW.

Then we get to the UFC in 1993, which didn't have formalized high caps on heavyweights for 7 years, until the CSAC implemented the first universal rule set in April of 2000, which included weight classes, strike limitations and time/round limits. They also added an allowance system that allows fighters to come in over weight.

MMA has been officially organized for 45 years; joe rogan is 53. It sounds like he skipped his prime to talk about being tough while dudes like Bas Rutten, Royce Gracie, or Randy Couture (who won a UFC belt after 40) stepped into the ring dozens or hundreds of times to prove it. Only Royce weighs less than Joe, btw.

Fuck dude, a 400 pound man named Eric ""Butterbean"" Esch went and won 97 pro boxing matches with 65 KOs across a 20 year career in which he appeared 126 times.

To summarize, Joe rogan is a lot smaller than you clearly think he is. The histories of modern fighting sports and their rules are very different than you think they are. I'm glad you understand the social harms his show and current talk tracks represent, but Joe rogan could have gone and backed up all his alpha male bullshit for decades and yet conveniently found himself outside the ring fight after fight after fight.

So no, it's not a profoundly stupid critique. It's based on the fact that the only barrier Joe Rogan ever faced to fighting professionally was his own appetite for getting hit back.""",I found one of the worst mma takes of all time on a different subreddit,28,1

One of the most enthusiastic and thoughtful responses was trying to sell him on not only Rizin, but specifically this years nearly All-Japan Rizin NYE card. I disagreed strongly.**

I do not recommend Rizin. It is not a high level event, especially this year's card. Tomorrow's card UFC 257 is something that might get you back into the sport. What better way than a big PPV.

There is an impossible amount to follow nowadays. The times even 10 years ago are long gone. If you want the best, most interesting elite championship best in the world level fighting ITS IN THE UFC. no need to mince words.

If you watch Rizin longing for the days ofPRIME JAPANESE MMA... you setting yourself up for disappointment. The quality and excitement of MMA in addition to the spectacle itself is a shell of it's former self, especially in regards to Rizin/JMMA.

With All That Said, I highly recommend Rizin's first 2 shows, where they held two shows with a tournament running on Dec 29 and Dec 31 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_in_Rizin_Fighting_Federation#Results the less you know the better futures some old LEGENDS that you will definitely remember. This 2015 event was the closest I got to feeling like the hey day. This event holds a special place in my heart.


As for the UFC/MMA as a whole, the two biggest changes that will make or break your return may be the introduction of Women's Weightclasses as well as the lighter weights under 155lbs, under lightweight. If you want good technique, advance entertaining fights WMMA isn't for you. There's a few... they are still in the infancy stages no insane insane back and forth multiple knockdown, multiple submissions or reversals type fights yet. I'm sure many will mention Weili/Joanna, but that was rock em sock em kickboxing not MMA. there was not MMA on display in that fight.

Overall, there is still a lot to love, but A LOT A LOT you can miss and won't feel much. All the divisions are fairly exciting right now after around the 2015-2018 period many UFC titles were held up. From 145 down to 125lbs flyweight, you will see some of the best technique, best cardio, high pace, exciting fights. But I'm talking about the last 3-4 years, you gotta get past certain long time title holders. Idk less spoilers the more exciting. I

I say this without hyperbole if you like exciting, back and forth fights that DO include grappling, entertaining grappling and striking flyweight is for you. I'd highly recommend the flyweight fights from the last 2-3 years. Perhaps starting with some select Mighty Mouse Johnson fights, before moving on to Cejudo, Benavidez, Figueiredo, Moreno current era. I find it very exciting. I think many people would become massive fans of flyweight if they watched all of Fig and Moreno's fights since 2019 and set themselves up for future investment too. The action, the storyline is all there.. it's just not like the old days anymore, you have to try to keep up. But at the same time, UFC the brand is MMA now as sad as that may sound, and they are only getting bigger with the ESPN, ESPN+ and ABC deal.

I long for days of ELITE #1 in the world ring, squared circle, MMA. Rizin 2015 mark it boi. You'll love it. Rizin World Grand Prix 2015: Part 2 - Iza on Dec. 31 is the card I'd recommend. If you simply turn on UFC this week and weeks to follow, especially if main card only, the storylines are all there for 2021-2022 to have some major major fights some of the biggest the sport has seen. 


**tl;dr Almost every division is exciting right now and now they also have rankings that make at least easier to know where someone is in the division even if the rankings don't always apply to who gets a title shot. And I think just putting it on here and there once or twice a month, you'll get back into it.**

**But it will never, ever be how it was like before.**","After about 10 years of following MMA, here is how I see the current state of MMA compared to late 2000s Spike, JMMA golden era and how old school/returning fans can get into ""UFC"" again",33,2

These are the guys who literally get hit in the head for a living, it's not just with MMA, from Tyson to Floyd, all have their fair share of fuck-ups outside the ring. But, how right is it to trash them as terrible human beings, just so we can feel good about our lives. It isn't about justifying their criminal acts, but about bringing those acts up in every single discussion regarding them, even if they have paid paid their dues &amp; served the punishment. 

Everyone commits mistakes, such that would qualify us as POS too, it's just these athletes commit these mistakes in public, is anyone that perfect to pass tall judgements about how trash an athlete is, not just once but every single time a discussion regarding their career takes place. Apart from their criminal acts, is it right to comment without any proof as if he cheats on his girlfriend or if he's a drug addict or calling fighters rapist etc. based on allegations rather than any conviction, or even if one consumes drugs or cheats, what's the point in bringing personal life in MMA discussions.

Also, where do we draw the line when it comes to trash talk, isn't it much like history written &amp; re-written by victors, take Conor for example, he talked loads of shit when he was facing Aldo, disrespecting Brazilians with that Favela comment &amp; similar such stuff in fan interviews, but after the win, everyone gave Conor a pass. While UFC 229 he lost &amp; everyone start shitting on him for his trash talk, while at the same time Khabib did lil' similar stuff as in insulting Irish about their language, mentioning Conor's grandfather_Christopher McGregor &amp; a brawl which can be compared with the dolly incident, but we gave him the pass, all Khabib's talk became iconic after victory, like Conor's trash talk after victory over Aldo. Also, how can one even say what's worse, hitting pregnant woman or giving threats from Insta handle? There's no end to this, what's vulgarity to me, could be another man's lyrics.

Overall, we should leave their outside the octagon stuff to them, it's part of the game to make all sorts of fun shit whenever they get in some fuck-ups, but to do it throughout their career as in with every mention of their names &amp; to the point painting them as some trash human beings who are beyond redemption, how right it is, What's your opinion on it?",How much outside the octagon antics of a fighter should factor in MMA discussions?,23,1

I saw one of the other fighters catch the other fighter's leg during a kick. Is there any rule stopping the fighter from quickly backpedaling and throwing their opponent off balance to fall or is this more difficult than it sounds?

I'm also assuming that dropping an elbow on their knee after you catch a leg or dropping your body to hyper extend their leg would be illegal as well. Like I think there is a rule that bars excessive injuries. 

Lastly is there a rule keeping you from dragging your opponent around the ring? Not that it would be particularly effective in any way.

I've watched mma for nearly two decades and have never fought. I know most general rules, but I don't know the nitty gritty of fighting and more obscure rules.

I am a long time UFC fan as well as a long time wrestler ( wrestled about 13 years from elementary school to college and i’m currently a highschool coach) i’m 22 and hungry. I loved everything about wrestling but unfortunately there is no where to go with it unless you are the best of the best. I’m looking to for somewhere where i can learn striking and Ju jitsu, i’ve taken some Ju jitsu but both of those martial arts i have very very little knowledge on. My question is , does anyone know a good MMA gym that’s well rounded and has some good trainers around the greensboro NC area? I don’t mind traveling i’ve had to do it my whole life for wrestling. However every gym i’ve personally seen in my area does not have the trainers or fighters with the reputation or experience i’m looking for.

With that said, any huge card, or any time Conor fights, there is a massive influx of new fans in this sub - particularly in the live chat. So much so that the live chat was more or less ruined by people 

a) asking for streams

b) asking extremely basic questions instead of googling

c) not understanding the sport

d) making the same shitty jokes

And probably a few more. When the chat was being flooded with ""Roundtree got robbed!"" is when I really just said ""fuck it, no point in the live chat tonight"".

So what can we do about it? 

2 live threads for these cards. 1 general, and one ""flaired users only"" thread. For those of you who want to hang with the casuals and answer their questions - stick to the general. For the rest of us who shitpost here constantly, get in the flaired threat.

But I was thinking before the fights conor was talking about how he was hard sparring through his camp with young athletic boxers and getting cracked and getting bloody noses and going hard.

How could the hard sparring contribute to this loss? Maybe he took too much head trauma during his camp and he came in compromised? Maybe he cut too much weight for the bout just to show he could make championship weight?

Or maybe poirier is that good and just hits that hard? After all the recent talks of no sparring Max being better and faster how much could lots of hard boxing sparring have affected him? 

I’ve never been a fan of conor but have always admired his skills in the octagon and never miss his fights because they build the best cards around him and his fights are always exciting win or lose but seeing him put out like that for the first time made me feel for him and if it becomes a regular thing where he gets rocked or put out in the future I’d love to see him retire before receiving life changing damage.

Conor was super respectful before and after the fight so that adds a lot to it. Also it’s only when there is a big fight and the “casuals” tune in and that’s probably why it happens because it’s done by people who don’t respect what the fighters do.

For this monthly edition of Let's Play Matchmaker, I will be taking a deep look at the lightweight division which stole the show last night, and whose title landscape has been completely altered due to the co-main, and the main events that took place. Let's take a look and see what the future holds for the 155 lb division.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get into the matchups, here's my lightweight rankings.

(C) Khabib Nurmagomedov

\#1 Dustin Poirier

\#2 Justin Gaethje

\#3 Charles Oliveira

\#4 Michael Chandler

\#5 Conor McGregor

\#6 Tony Ferguson

\#7 Dan Hooker

\#8 Rafael Dos Anjos

\#9 Paul Felder

\#10 Diego Ferreira

&amp;#x200B;

This division was already chaotic as it was, but now it is on fire, featuring an unpredictable landscape loaded with staggering levels of talent. It's truly the golden age of lightweight. Not only that, but Nate Diaz is planning on returning to 155, and Russia's Islam Makhachev is possibly poised to have a breakthrough in 2021, with all of his hype leading to a bout with Drew Dober in March. This is definitive can't miss TV, and we're all here to witness it. With all of that being said, here's who the winners and losers of 257 should face next.

&amp;#x200B;

DAN HOOKER

&amp;#x200B;

1st option for Dan Hooker: Nate Diaz

&amp;#x200B;

Unfortunately for Dan Hooker, he's been on the wrong end of his last two fights, losing to Dustin Poirier by a close unanimous decision in an absolute war, and then last night against Michael Chandler in his explosive UFC debut. This time, Hooker was TKO'd in just half a round, because Chandler drew him in with a body shot, then knocked down Hooker with a huge haymaker that sparked the beginning of the end for Hooker. Now with a two fight losing streak, Hooker really needs to get back into the win column, or his career could continue to regress. Thankfully, Hooker is 30, and he's got more than enough time to get back on track. He can start with Nate Diaz, the world famous brawler who returns to lightweight for the first time since 2015. Diaz of course had his on an off stint at welterweight in which he fought Conor McGregor twice, beating him the first time, and breaking box office records in the second fight. Diaz then took a staggering 3 year layoff, and shocked the world in his return with a dominant win over Anthony Pettis in August 2019. Then, he squared off with Jorge Masvidal just months after that win, and was controversially TKO'd due to a doctor stoppage. Now here we are in 2021, Diaz has once again had a long layoff, and now he's planning on returning to MMA along with his brother Nick, supposedly. Diaz and Hooker have been linked for quite some time, with Diaz giving Hooker some props, and wanting to fight the New Zealander at catchweight. Now that Diaz plans a return to 155, Hooker could be the perfect opponent for him. Both are fan favorites with styles that could absolutely create a bout worthy of a 50k bonus.

&amp;#x200B;

2nd option for Dan Hooker: Rafael Dos Anjos

&amp;#x200B;

RDA's return to lightweight kicked off with a win over Paul Felder in November, in which the Irish Dragon was entering the bout on ridiculously short notice. RDA-Hooker would likely headline a fight night in April or May, and it would make since for both fighter's next steps in their careers.

&amp;#x200B;

MICHAEL CHANDLER

&amp;#x200B;

1st option for Michael Chandler: Charles Oliveira (potential title eliminator)

&amp;#x200B;

What a debut for the former Bellator champion. Michael Chandler just silenced the doubters with a finish, and McGregor's loss will do him a big favor in propelling him up the 155 rankings come Tuesday. To top all of that, in his post fight interview, Chandler decided to sprinkle in some character development, unexpectedly transitioning from his pre-fight persona similar to Stephen Thompson, to a confrontational bad guy like Colby Covington, and call out the entirety of the divisions elites. I think I would like to see Chandler get a 5 round bout if Dustin Poirier fights Khabib for the title. A fight with a white hot Charles Oliveira makes too much sense for Michael Chandler, and a clash between the two would give the winner a sure fire shot at UFC gold sometime late this year. However, if Khabib stays away from the fight game, then we should think about a really serious question...

&amp;#x200B;

2nd option for Michael Chandler: Dustin Poirier (title fight)

&amp;#x200B;

This option is very unlikely, even if Khabib is gone. The reason why, is because Oliveira and Chandler have both made convincing arguments to fight for world title in their next bouts, but there is no clear opposition to Poirier if Khabib vacates the title. It would be pretty surprising to see Chandler leapfrog Oliveira without a fight with the Brazilian, then get an undisputed title shot in just his 2nd UFC bout. But what about a third option?

&amp;#x200B;

3rd option for Michael Chandler: Justin Gaethje

&amp;#x200B;

Two college wrestlers, two prolific careers outside of the UFC, two guys with punching power, two guys who each fought the 6th ranked contender in their debuts (Gaethje fought then 6th ranked Michael Johnson in 2017 for his debut). WSOF vs Bellator, who ya got? Ok, in all honesty the bout is an incredible matchup, and it makes a decent amount of sense, but Gaethje is more likely going to face Charles Oliveira according to Dana White. Still, Gaethje-Chandler for 5 rounds is something to consider.

&amp;#x200B;

DUSTIN POIRIER

&amp;#x200B;

1st (and only) option for Dustin Poirier: A Title shot

&amp;#x200B;

Paid in full. That's motto has appropriately summed up Dustin Poirier's career. Every accomplishment that the Louisiana fighter has gotten to this point has been a result of his hard work, big heart, and perhaps the greatest evolution we've ever seen a fighter have in the octagon in UFC history. There's no doubt in my mind, or anyone else's mind that Dustin Poirier will fight for the title next, and these last two wins did plenty to insure that his ticket for a title fight is, well, you know, PAID IN FULL. The real question is...who does he even face? If Khabib decides to fight again, then its obvious, Poirier will challenge Nurmagomedov once again, and it will most likely happen later this year. However, if Khabib stays away, the title will likely be stripped from him, and Poirier will face either Charles Oliveira or Michael Chandler for the title. The UFC will either make Gaethje-Oliveira or Oliveira-Chandler as a 5 round bout later this year. Or we'll get Gaethje-Chandler perhaps in a 5 rounder that will be the necessary next step for either fighter to get closer to the top contender spot. These are confusing, yet exciting times for the 155 division.

&amp;#x200B;

CONOR MCGREGOR

&amp;#x200B;

1st option for Conor McGregor: Tony Ferguson?

&amp;#x200B;

Who knows where Conor goes from here. That finish was one of the most unexpected outcomes to a UFC fight we've ever seen, and now Conor McGregor's career is in major question, due to that unbelievable TKO by Poirier in just two rounds. Back in December I said that a fight between McGregor and Ferguson was likely never going to happen due to the completely one-sided bout between El Cucuy and Oliveira. I also suggested that Ferguson make the move back up to welterweight. However, with 170 already as competitive as it is, that move may not be appropriate for Ferguson, nor may it ever happen with his age. If Ferguson stays at lightweight, then maybe, just maybe McGregor-Ferguson is now the fight to make. There may be a much lower level of hype around the bout because of the negative trajectory that both fighters are showing, but like the other PPVs headlined by McGregor, it should clear 1 million buys, and possibly be the exact bout that McGregor needs to get some positive energy in corner.

&amp;#x200B;

2nd option for Conor McGregor: Nate Diaz III

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest rivalry in MMA history before Khabib-Conor, was already one half Conor. That was the 2016 rivalry of Nate Diaz and Conor McGregor. The UFC is a sport that proves that if one fighter gets injured, it could uncover a money making machine like the rivalry between McGregor and Diaz. The score is 1-1, with Diaz taking the first fight via submission, and McGregor edging Diaz in the second fight to a majority decision. Getting Diaz and McGregor in the ring now makes a ton of sense for both fighters, as both are in the loss column, and both are trying to get to the top of the division. Plus, if the rumors are true about the UFC not wanting to book Ferguson against Diaz, then who else is there for him. McGregor-Diaz III would sell extremely well in 2021, and it provides McGregor a potentially fantastic opportunity to get back on the right path in the search for 155 gold.

&amp;#x200B;

3rd option for Conor McGregor: Justin Gaethje

&amp;#x200B;

The reason why Gaethje is so far down this list, is because Gaethje is a very dangerous fight for McGregor, especially at this point. It's high risk, and high reward for McGregor, and with a win, the Mac is back in the middle of the title race, or maybe even right there with Dustin in a trilogy bout for the undisputed title. :0. Or, if McGregor loses, his career will continue to sink, and he may retire from the UFC, FOR GOOD this time. Gaethje's approach would be very similar to Poirier's with an onslaught of brutal calf kicks likely being peppered by Gaethje in order to destabilize McGregor, and land some major combos to get the finish. Like I said, this fight is high risk, high reward for McGregor, which is why its Plan C rather than Plan A on this list.

just a novice/noob looking to start a martial art in something that focuses mostly on striking speed, power, and high endurance, etc. However, I didn't know where to start exactly, I was thinking of something in Thai Boxing since that involves standing up and striking, which involves speed and high power.  

I'm interested in learning a martial art that's centered around striking and standing up. Just a little bit about myself, I do a mixture of weight training, bodyweight training, and a bit of cardio in the gym.

But, I'm just wondering whether, or not Muay Thai maybe be for me, or not. I'm willing to try it out and it looks interesting to me on a personal level since it uses a combined use of fists, elbows, knees, and kicks. 

Anyway, would you recommend it for someone whose mostly looking for something in speed, high impacts? I'm 5'11 (180cm), 80kgs with an average body type,

Overeem has stated many times recently he is making ""one final run"" at the heavyweight championship 

I think he is most likely the most *technically* sound Heavyweight in the division, second only to Stipe Miocic.

It is also worth noting that he dropped Stipe when they fought, so I dont think its crazy to say he could beat him in a rematch.

I think he will get through Volkov, then we have to wait to see what happens with Stipe vs Ngannou.

If Ngannou beats Stipe: I feel if Overeem uses the wrestling he used against Sakai in his last fight, he could beat Ngannou in a similar fashion that Stipe did (wrestle fuck and drain his gas tank). Obviously anyone can get caught by Ngannou's bombs though.

If Stipe beats Ngannou: I feel like Overeem has a very good chance to win the rematch. He dropped him in the first fight, but made the mistake of going for a guillotine. They both possess the skill and power to beat each other.

I think it's interesting how for the last year and a half he's been heavily training out of his old boxing gym. Yet we haven't saw the fruits of it, if anything the boxing base style made him look really flat footed and susceptible to leg kicks. He just did look as fluid and his weapons completely limited. I personally think he should be sticking with roddy on all aspects of his striking.

I don't think his performance was as bad as people did, dustin just had an excellent game plan and came out on top. I didn't see anything from McGregor warranted being finished and how he's dealt with the loss couldn't be better.

Conor &amp; Dustin would be perfect. It'll bring in a ton of viewers and hype the hell out of the trilogy fight *and* if you put the belt on the line it would be icing on the cake. 


I think the better one to do would be Izzy and Jones but Conor would bring in more casual viewers. 


Colby and Masvidal would be fun for about two episodes and then we'd all get tired of their personalities. Though Colby and Masvidal share poliical views, Colby would potentially be too controversial in my opinion. 


Some may argue that Conor is too nice currently, but I think he'd basically be the Gordon Ramsey of coaches. Nice but witty and knows how to  ham it up for the cameras + can flip the switch if he sees you fucking up.

I wasnt sure what he meant, so looked it up and jesus bloody christ, the things the man has accomplished. 
 
Not including the pre-mma things 
Started striking and competing in MMA at age 30
Became a champion in two separate organisations at age 31
Won the Strikeforce HW Grand Prix at age 33
Became the UFC LHW champion at age 36
Defended the LHW belt for the last time, after 3 successful defenses and 1 NC, at age 38
Won and defended the UFC HW title, becoming the second two-division champion, first HW and LHW double champion, and first to hold AND defend two separate titles, at age 39
Fought his last fight, a competitive 3rd bout against the most successful UFC heavyweight of all time, at age 41

think about how many former champions have lost it by age 35 - Shogun, Rashad Evans, Fedor, Cro Cop... DC was a double champ at 39 years old!!
plus something that is constantly ignored is the fact dc hurt his back and went for surgery before the jones fight 1. he's literally said since then, he cant wrestle as much anymore and the back pain tires him out faster. i didnt think much about it then, but dc was winning the first fight till he gassed. even in the second fight, he was winning till he got caught with that head kick. thinking about it now though, dc has an amazing head roll and he usually blocks those with his hand, but that kick was blindingly fast. it was just insane. at the time i thought it was just jones being skilled. however he's since been caught using peds and post that jones has not shown that kinda speed since at all.... well you guys get what im getting at. 

im honestly wondering what a young prime dc would have been like in the UFC. young DC's fights in pre UFC was just ridiculous, especially against other champs. Even then, he fought in the UFC from age 36 to 41 and was one of the most dominant fighters ever.

This is also completely ignoring all of his other achievements and accomplishments outside of the Octagon, and some of the most horrific personal losses and experience, he's still such a class-act he was as an ambassador for the sport and one of the best commentators ever imo

A truly legendary career!

Underrated - Kamaru Usman. Been going on a quiet tear since his debut. Nobody cares about him because he’s boring though. Lost one fight which was the second in his career, and beat like 6/10 of the top 10 in his division(if Leon was still ranked where he should be). Probably a top 3 WW, but gets no love.

Undisputed - Jon Jones. 12 defenses. Won the belt 3 times. Beat like 7 guys that held a belt at one point. Killers all over his resume. Will easily be LHW GOAT for next 10 years. Will be years before anyone gets even close to him.

Forgotten - Khabib. He’s great, but will get dropped quick from GOAT position, once media attention stops. Probably settle in that Daniel Cormier like position. Will never be able to convince new fans post mcgreggor years that a guy with like 15 wins over wikipedialess guys that are  2-5, and has three defenses is the GOAT. Just the reality of his situation. Didn’t do enough, even if he’s likely good enough.","Whose legacy do you think will stand the test of time and still be one of the greats, or be looked back on as underrated/overrated 10 years from now?",295,1

We were discussing what style would make it better in the street, boxing and wrestling as base vs muay thai and bjj. I said in the streets because in the cage both styles seem pretty formidable an we have great fighters from both sides. What's your opinion on this?

Known as the gatekeeper of his division, one thing about RDA is he backs down from no one, and in his last 20 fights he has fought a long line of absolute killers. To me there is nothing more cringe then hearing a ESPN watching casual talk bad about RDA. Thankfully Reddit MMA has the least casuals of any platform, and although I usually find myself rooting for America whenever the two fan bases collide, one things for certain you gotta love and respect the heart this man has win or lose, victory or defeat. His last 20 fights include...

In 1993, he fled with his family to his mother's native Uzbekistan due to the ongoing Tajik civil war.

Muradov was forced to drop out of school and start working at the age of 15 to provide for his family after his father got involved in a car accident that left him permanently disabled. At the age of 17, he began his successful combat sambo career, and because of that, he earned a well-paid job as a security guard in Russian Siberia. He was seriously stabbed and shot several times while working there. 

When his father got released from hospital after four years, his family had to sell their house to pay for healthcare bills. Muradov returned to Uzbekistan and eventually managed to make enough money from fighting for his parents to be able to buy the house back. Shortly afterwards, the 19 year old Muradov moved to Czech Republic in search of a better job to earn more money for his family and himself. There, he worked various jobs such as construction site worker, janitor and waiter. He started training Muay Thai and MMA in Prague under the tutelage of Petr Kníže, who allowed Muradov to train and sleep in his gym for free. 

During his early time in Prague, Muradov controversially appeared in autoerotic porn productions and softcore porn photo shoots under the stage name ""Akhmed Virt"" for William Higgins' gay pornographic production company.

In February 2018 Muradov became world's first mixed martial artist signed by Floyd Mayweather Jr.'s The Money Team. They became friends after they met each other at Prague's Lávka Club in March 2017.

Muradov made his promotional UFC debut against Alessio Di Chirico on September 28, 2019 at UFC on ESPN+ 18 as a replacement for injured Peter Sobotta. He took the fight on 12 days notice. He won the fight via unanimous decision.

As of September 29, 2019, he was ranked #1 in the Tapology's Eastern European middleweight rankings.

I have taken my vcp in 2018 , my vcap deploy in 2019 ( 6.5 ) and was putting off the design exam for a while now . I can see that the design exam has two options, one for 6.5 and the other for v7 .

I've heard people refer to Volkov as ""what Struve could have been if he learned how to manage distance,"" and with Struve being the tallest fighter in the UFC, I wondered how accurate Volkov's 6'7"" listing truly is. Now this is all speculation, but I've heard rumors that Volkov might supposedly be closer to 6'11"" than his listed 6'7"", even from a commentator in his last fight (I believe, not 100% sure). In the attached image of Volkov's stare down with 6'3"" (allegedly) Derrick Lewis, Volkov seems 5-6 inches taller even when he's looking down at Lewis while Lewis is looking up. If he's 6'11"" vs 6'7"" he's still gonna dwarf his opponents, but just something to discuss.

You batter one guy and he moves up a class and becomes world champion, you put a clinic on against another fella and he goes and becomes one of the biggest stars in the sport and you’re fighting on the undercard of his made up belt.

It got me thinking, seen as Wonderboy would surely be very confident of beating Whittaker, did he ever challenge him for the middleweight strap? A first round demolition job victory is a pretty big bargaining chip to getting a title shot even if it is a new weight class.

I notice when I listen to mma commentary, there are 2 sides of the coin. One is trying to predict what will happen in a fight and predicting a winner (think weasel mma/Kenny Florian) ...the other involves merely trying to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the fighters and what each has to do to win (think jack slack/Luke Thomas). 

After ufc 257, seeing hooker and mcgregor both getting chinned so quickly, I reaffirm what has always been common sense, that anything can happen in a fight.

So I checked the numbers for Aldo's two Frankie Edgar fights, the 5-round Mendes rematch and Aldo's last two fights to compare him to 'his prime'.

On the left side is who Aldo fought, while all of the numbers are Aldo's strikes against them.

&amp;#x200B;

||Round 1|Round 2|Round 3|Round 4|Round 5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UFC 156- Edgar (2013)|21|19|15|7|14|
|UFC 179- Mendes (2014)|37|18|21|9|17|
|UFC 200- Edgar (2016)|14|14|17|16|19|
|UFC 251- Yan (2020)|14|24|29|15|1\*|
|Vera (2020)|19|24|2\*\*|||

\*He turtled up 16 seconds into the round, so we can omit that from consideration.

\*\*Aldo had 4 minutes and 53 seconds of control time, which he spent trying submissions.

I should also add that against Yan, Aldo landed the most leg kicks than he has done in any fight since the Ricardo Lamas bout, which is one day removed from 7 years ago.

Now here's the output of his opponents, in terms of significant strikes landed:

||Round 1|Round 2|Round 3|Round 4|Round 5|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|UFC 156- Edgar (2013)|5|7|19|11|18|
|UFC 179- Mendes (2014)|25|16|10|17|9|
|UFC 200- Edgar (2016)|14|14|21|20|10|
|UFC 251- Yan (2020)|33|16|39|44|62|
|Vera (2020)|16|28|2|||

So not only was he generally more active in his last 2 fights than those considered to be his best performances while in his prime, his opponents are landing more too, which equates to closer fights than he had against Edgar and Mendes.",Comparing Aldo's significant strike output from his best performances to the Yan/Chito fights,110,38

TL;DR he was born in the wrong era.

If you look at his Judo record, one can imagine an alternative universe where he went to the Olympics and won a gold medal. Seriously, his Judo career is insane. In Wikipedia's words, he *had a winning streak of 47 straight victories without conceding a single koka.*

Rather than trying to deal with political infighting (which stopped him from going to the Olympics in the first place) and age, he instead went to MMA in his mid 30s, had his reputation warped into some kind of villain by PRIDE, made his professional MMA debut against Sakuraba, was given Rampage Jackson on his 3rd fight while on a losing streak, and lost via decision to Murilo Bustamante to accumulate a 0-4 record.

Although he later turned his career around with a dramatic submission win against Melvin Manhoef, he never found all that much success in the ring due to age, near complete lack of striking skills, and insanely tough competition.",Judoka who made his MMA debut against Sakuraba,42,79

The first (and second) of many bonuses to come for Gaethje. Michael Johnson was 17-11 going into the fight, and has gone 2-4 since then. 

Eddie Alvarez - (0-1 in the UFC, 1-1 in ONE FC) After a spectacular debut, Gaethje is thrown to the wolves facing a recently dethroned champion. After Eddie lost to Conor, he had a close bout with Dustin Poirier that ended in a no contest. Then he fought Gathje, and won. His only fight in the UFC post-Gaethje is a rematch to Poirier in which he was finished in the second round. However, he has fought in ONE FC where he has yet to leave the first round, being TKO'd by Timofey Nastyukhin, then submitting Eduard Folayang. Eddie was 28-5(1) going into the fight, and 1-2 overall since the fight.

Dustin Poirier - (4-1) The exception to the rule. Dustin Poirier is the one and only fighter to have fought Justin Gaethje in the UFC, and held a winning record afterwards. His only loss was to Khabib, and since losing to Gaethje, he won his rematch with Eddie Alvarez, beat Max Holloway (again), beat Dan Hooker, and finished Conor McGregor. Dustin is the mold breaker. The Diamond is the only one that didn't crack. He entered the fight 22-5-1 and has gone 4-1 since then, making him the uncrowned champion in many eyes. 

James Vick - (0-3 UFC, 0-1 XMMA) After losing to Gaethje, he fought 3 more times with the UFC being brutally finished in two of those losses then he was cut. After which he fought for XMMA (on an event without a wikipedia page) where he was TKO'd in the second round. He came into the fight with a record of 13-1 (9-1 UFC) and has gone 0-4 since. 

Edson Barboza - (1-2) After Gaethje got back to his winning ways with Vick, he continued with Barboza. After losing to Khabib, and Kevin Lee, Barboza put on an absolute clinic against Dan Hooker. Then, he was given Justin Gaethje, whose UFC record at the time stood a measly 2-2 with wins that were not aging well. In a 1/2 round fight of the night, Gaethje finished Barboza halfway through the first round. Though the finish would be marred by an eye poke right before the final punch. Barboza lost his next fight at Lightweight, then dropped down to Featherweight where he lost his debut fight, but has since rebounded with a win over Makwan Amirkhani. He came into the fight with a 20-6 record, and has gone 1-2 since then.

Donald Cerrone - (0-2-1) After losing to Gaethje, Donald has fought 3 times. He was finished by Conor Mcgregor in 40 seconds, then lost a decision to Anthony Pettis, and fought to a draw with Niko Price after Niko was deducted a point in the first round for eye pokes. Donald entered the fight with Gaethje with a record of 36-12(1), and has gone 0-2-1 since.

Tony Ferguson - (0-1) Justins best win to date, Tony Ferguson entered the fight as the clear and rightful next challenger for the lightweight title. A 12 fight win streak that stretched over 6 years was snapped by an absolute mauling from Justin that was mercifully ended in the 5th round. Earning Justin Gaethje a chance at the lightweight title, and cementing him as the final opponent for Khabib Nurmagomedov.

5. KZ

6. Kattar (needs like 10 years off)

7. Emmet

10. Sodiq (booked against #9)

11. Ige (booked against #14)

So who should they fight, here’s who I’d say

Zabit vs Yair once the suspension ends

KZ vs Emmet

Burgos should be rescheduled for Hakeem

In his 47 career wins, only 5 are by decision which is an absolutely insane finish rate of 89%, with 25 by KO/TKO and 17 by submission.

Which fight was it? And what impact did it have, if any, on the winning fighter's next career steps? (Also, this thought was sparked while listening to a Gaethje interview where he states something along the lines of Tony never being a top tier fighter, he just fought with tactics that no one fought well against on his long run to title contention--which, to me, doesn't make any fucking sense--Gaethje Interview 14:40--on for the Tony assessment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzUqLD3mGQo&amp;ab_channel=ESPNMMA).

For me, I think immediately to Tyron Woodley vs Kamaru Usman. I remember watching in somewhat disbelief as Tyron just could not get any significant offense going despite the fight being exactly where you would imagine he would want it to be. It definitely helped Kamaru's solidification as a legitimate champion, but how much did it mean if the Tyron he beat was the one we have seen as of late?

Tony has been knocked down or rock so many times in his career and had to pull off come from behind wins. 

**Justin Gaethje and Charles Oliveira**

- Clear cut top 5 guys right now in the prime of their careers at the time of win 

- Tony did the infamous double weight cut for the Gaethje fight and ended up looking bad. He said in the post fight interview that he had been preparing for a grappler (Khabib) for a long time

- he got badly outstruck and badly outgrappled 

**Donald Cerrone was on a win streak at LW and top 5 at the time**

- He beat Alex Hernandez and Yaquinta, but after losing to Tony, who most people expected him to, he lost to Gaethje and Conor and more making the win look even worse and most people forgetting or not even caring it was top 5 LW win at the time. 

**Pettis, Lando Friggin V, Edson, Michael Johnson all out struck or hurt/knockdown Tony bad at many moments in the fights** 

- Tony gets hit a lot and has been knocked down by inferior strikers as Justin Gaethje. He wins these fights with sheer heart and will but the smarter fighter more skilled fighter not the tougher fighter prevails 

**Tony vs Kevin Lee, Danny Castillo** 

- Tony showed two times in his career his willingness to be on bottom. 

Tony’s biggest win to date was against Rafael dis Anjos, who had enough of lightweight moving up to welterweight. And it was 48-47 not a domination. **A common theme in Tony’s fights are a lack of domination**. 

**tl;dr** Looking back at his wins and performances not only was he unable to dominate, he was almost finished, taken down and taken many shots. In addition, none of his past opponents had the same ability, ranking and momentum that Justin Gaethje and Charles Oliveira brought. In hindsight, it was *extremely easy* to overrate Tony because of his win streak, cardio and finishing ability on the ground and feet alone. But on closer examination, he rarely dominated and was in serious trouble against lesser fighters such as Anthony Pettis, Kevin Lee, Lando Vannata which were all fights in the latter half of his win streak. Tony got me. 

Also, Gaethje’s defeats to Poirier and struggling against Michael Johnson are not that big of a deal as he clearly changed his style big time by the time he fought Cerrone becoming more patient and looking for counter shots. The fact Gaethje was coming off 3 1st round KOs was easy to think he was still just a random KO artist that could only do it against lesser competition. As opposed to a 5 round domination. Justin and Oliveira’s past defeats made people overlook how much better of a fighter they had become in the last 2 years while Tony stagnated if not deteriorated possibly aided by a double weight cut (remember Michael Chandler didn’t fight again right away even as the back up title fighter). 

**Where does Tony Ferguson go from here?** 

- Seems very unlikely Tony will see a steep drop in opposition level. 

- Tony wants Nate Diaz? Hmmm that might be not horrible for Tony this would not be a bad option at 170. And more money 

- It’ll be pretty sad if Tony loses to someone like Dan Hooker but at this point they’re both on two fight losing streaks in kinda makes sense. 

- Chandler, McGregor, Aloe Vera, Poirier and Gaethje are all not options for Tony next 

- Al Iaquinta. boom. Or Felder. Winnable fights to keep his ranking vs guys still top 10 striking oriented. or we’ll really know Tony is done after this. Look at the unranked LW killers coming up too. Brad Riddell, Fiziev, Mike Davis, Guram, Mateusz Gamrot and lightweight just gets tougher and tougher everyday. Tony’s aura is gone. 

Now, we don’t even know if he can hang in the top 10 anymore. He could possibly be a Chris Weidman type. Weidman just beat Ahkmedov but didn’t look great doing it for example, but it kept his top 10 ranking. It’s a sad time being a Tony fan. I think Nate Diaz is the best option but I’m not sure how likely.",Tony Ferguson honest career assessment from a Tony fan,25,0

UFC clearly want to see him against ranked opponents but something always comes up and the fights are scrapped. The only fight that Barcelos has actually been in over the past 14 months was against Khalid Taha, when Barcelos stepped up on 7 days notice to save the day.

So the Stamann fight gets cancelled due to COVID, fair enough.

The Commission forced the cancellation of the Merab fight, for reasons that appear to be entirely nonsensical.

And now that Assuncao has pulled out of the Feb 27 fight it appears we may be in real danger of not getting another Barcelos fight any time soon.

We know we want a ranked opponent, but would anyone in the top 15 step up on short notice to face such a dangerous fighter?

Or will we see the destruction of a scrub? A fight that does nothing to move him up the rankings as he edges closer to his mid 30s?

He is a legit prospect to be a title challenger but he isn't getting any younger, please Dana, make something good happen.

In Boxing, with such a well-documented and long history, it is easy to place any given fighter's accomplishments in context. MMA does not yet have this luxury. Despite this, and barring new fighters racking up more impressive records, I strongly believe the Big Nog will be remembered as the consensus #2 HW in MMA.

**Record**
A single statistic to illustrate this: for his first 37 fights he beat or went to a draw with every single fighter he faced who isn't the consensus HW goat (not that he didn't lose twice, but he avenged each loss decisively). And this wasn't an early-career Khabib win streak. His 3rd fight was against Vajentim Overeem. His fifth was against veteran Jeremy Horn with a 37-6-4 record. His seventh was against Dan Henderson.

The other day I saw someone posted, with hundreds of upvotes, waxing poetic about Stipe's recent competition, where he had faced Ngannou, DC x3 and Ngannou over three years, asking who has faced such fearsome competition.

In 5 fights over a 12 MONTH PERIOD Big Nog faced:
* Semmy Schilt (HW Kickboxing GOAT with a respectable MMA career)
* Dan Henderson (2x Olympian, Strikeforce and Pride 205lbs champ)
* Fedor (consensus HW GOAT)
* Ricco Rodriguez (UFC champ and gold medalist at ADCC)
* Mirko Cro Cop (needing no introduction)

Big Nog unquestionably has a better record against better competition than Fedor, the GOAT. He simply beat more good guys, being one of three fighters to win titles in PRIDE and the UFC. The only reason he isn't regarded as the greatest is that he lost decisively to Fedor, and those fights were so convincing that without fighting Nog Fedor would be little more than a footnote.

**Level Of Competition**
Moreover, many of Nog's wins are even better under scrutiny than they are on paper. Beating Sapp is literally something a 12 year old could do these days, but beating Sapp on the night Nog faced him was so overwhelmingly impressive that the fight is still regarded as the ultimate underdog's triumph. 

What truly makes Noguiera's record so unmatched is that virtually his entire competition were in their primes. Unlike todays HW division, littered with ancients, PRIDE was the first big MMA organization. The talent it attracted weren't veterans, but a worldwide talent pool of fresh and hungry young men. Although the MMA-specific technique wasn't as refined in those early days, the sport specific technique was actually better, as PRIDE recruited heavily from Olympians, ADCC, K-1 and more. All this is to say that doing something like defending the PRIDE HW belt 5x (significantly more than anyone in the UFC has been able to do), is extremely impressive in such a volatile division with such a volatile roster.

Looking at the level of competition in PRIDE, it is easy to make the case that it was the HW golden era where everyone fought each other, as opposed to the Golden Era of HWs in the early 2010s where nobody fought each other.

**Technique**
Technically, Nog stands up well when watching old tape. He could rock and sometimes KO you. Although his boxing was not as technical as many top fighters these days, his hands were fundamentally sound, though at times he descended into flurries reminiscent of Wanderlei. He could initiate takedowns well, and was a master at ending up in advantageous positions for his game plan off the scramble. Obviously submissions were his bread and butter, finishing over half his wins. It's a low bar, but the fact that he could KO you, take you down, and submit you implies he possessed a more well rounded skillset than most of the current HW top 10.

**Legacy**
If you study tape it is easy to see that Big Nog has the single most impressive record in HW MMA, and arguably all of MMA, based simply on who he beat and when in their primes he beat them, all while sustaining minimal losses. It is a shame that current conversations ignore him as the #2 HW GOAT.",Is Antonio Rodrigo Nogueira the present day's most underrated fighter?,188,1

The BW division was essentially set on fire in that instant, as he was immediately stripped. Immediately, the MMA community noticed a dearth of worthy contenders, from a field of young contenders, exciting prospects, and aging legends. 

Many ideas for how to solve the title picture were floated, and ultimately a bout between Petr Yan and Jose Aldo was booked for the vacant belt, but I mentally put together a Grand Prix for the title, with the following entrants:

Aldo, Yan, Sterling, Sandhagen, Moraes, Edgar, Munoz, Garbrandt, Dvalishvili, Cruz, Cejudo, Faber, Vera, Dillashaw. Vera and Dvalishvili were added after big wins that summer. I thought the roster was a good mix of existing talent and fun older guys who still had something. The first round matchups would be decided once the UFC got around to booking anything.

So what's it like right now? I'll dive into this and go a little more in depth than naming a couple of names and by a little more in depth I mean you can go grab breakfast and read this and still finish breakfast first. There will be a few points and tiers that I'll explain right now:

- elite: best of the best. capable of beating anyone at the very top of the division as well as the champ himself.

- tier 2: a few fighters who are just short of elite. They are capable of beating the person who beat them just the day prior with a change of judges.

- prospects: people who show promise to be in tier 2 or above.

- exciting: my favorites in the lower rankings. I'll just list them. Now to start but first, let me introduce-

**The Champ**

C) Stipe Miocic (38). They say the average fighter is good for 9 years and hits their peak at 34. Stipe has fought in the UFC for just over 9 years but at 38 years old he remains the champion. Many fans are hoping to see him beat Ngannou then Jones to cement himself as the unquestionable, undisputed heavyweight GOAT. Will he succeed, or will he succumb to Father Time?


**Elite**

1) Francis Ngannou (34). We all know who this is. Ngannou's currently training at Xtreme Couture, preparing for Stipe Miocic on 3/27.

2) Curtis Blaydes (29). Some say his style is boring but no one can deny his talent. This man has beaten everyone he has ever faced except Ngannou, leaving him in a slightly awkward position. He fights Derrick Lewis on 2/20.

3) Jairzinho Rozenstruik (32, turns 33 March). 76-8 in kickboxing now 11-1 in MMA (that 1 being Ngannou). Although he defeated Overeem in a questionable stoppage for some, he proved he belongs at the top with his heavy hands and prodigious skill. He faces Ciryl Gane on 2/27.

6) Alexander Volkov (32). Many people have noticed his steady increase in weight and upper body thickness, and so have I. He's no Arnold but gone are the days when he looked like a walking pyramid. He's finally filling out his frame and just a couple of days ago he got the biggest win of his career. Currently ranked number 6 but the UFC should be updating soon.

7) Ciryl Gane (30, turns 31 April). Extremely unorthodox and unique striking. He has sparred a couple of times with Ngannou and although he doesnt count him as a friend, they know each other well enough for Gane to ask not to face him if it's not for the belt. Fun fact: he beat Yassine Boughanem, an extremely talented fighter and is currently the WKN Super Heavyweight champ in muay thai.

4) Derrick Lewis (36). Mr. Swang n' Bang, disciple of the art of Just Stand Up. He nonetheless has consistently beaten his opponents with good timing and an underrated, well rounded game. Even when faced with stronger opponents on paper, he can always count on his power as the great equalizer.

5) Alistair Overeem (40). Considered the best fighter in the division skill wise, Overeem has slowed down a tad. His punches have lost some pop and he is not the man he used to be. However, he remains a dangerous opponent and anyone who can beat him immediately joins the elites at the top of the division.

**Tier 2**

8) Shamil Abdurakhimov (39). A solid striker with fast hands and decent power.

9) Augusto Sakai (29). He has been in a few questionable decisions and has had a few questionable actions (fence grab in Ivanov fight for example) but he's young and he can grow.

10) Aleksei Oleinik (43). The Boa Constrictor. Very weird striking, like what one would imagine how an ape would box but the power is thunderous and ultimately, he wants to get you on the ground so he can apply crushing pressure. Very apt nickname. Fighting Chris Daukus 2/20.

11) Walt Harris (37). I just wish they'd give him easier fights after Overeem and Volkov. Wish him well.

11) (yes, according to the UFC he's tied for 11th place with Harris) Junior Dos Santos (37?). My favorite fighter but I have to admit, he's being delusional. I still think he's very good, a solid top 15 but he insists he can become champion again and even losing to the 1,2,3 ranked fighters as well as Gane haven't changed his mind. Still dangerous, but he's not touching the belt ever again. At least, not in the UFC.

13) Blagoy Ivanov (34). 666. Not much to say but he's had some good fights. His fight with Rothwell and Tuivasa were like tanks blasting at each other point blank.

15) Marcin Tybura (35). He has a nice win streak going on right now and is the first person to stop Greg Hardy. He had an amazingly high paced fight with Rothwell that I recommend watching.

Tai Tuivasa (27). Fun guy. Not elite by any means but with the right matchups his fights are fireworks. Fighting Don'Tale Mayes 3/20. This is a right matchup.

Andrei Arlovski (42). Hes doing what Junior should be doing: fighting at a lower rank. Surprisingly, his change in style from exciting knockout artist to ""I just want to win"" has done him good. Next bout against Tom Aspinall 2/20.

Ben Rothwell (39). Believe it or not, he was a hot prospect surging towards the title. Unfortunately he was stopped by politics. Well, politics, Junior Dos Santos' foot and a bit of a failed drug test in 2017. Now he's back! Aaaaand stopped again, this time by Tybura. Still, he's one of my favorite fighters to watch with a very unorthodox style of striking. Fighting Lins 3/13. Recommend watching btw.

Sergey Spivak (26). Hes listed as 6'3. I really dont believe it because like Volkov he looks immense, much taller than his listed height. Nothing special as of now, but hes very young. Facing Jared Vanderaa on 2/20. I'm betting on him.

**Prospects**

15) Sergei Pavlovich (28). His lack of wrestling was exposed by Overeem but his first loss being to Overeem in such a fashion isn't all bad. Now he knows his shortcomings and can come back better than ever. I just wonder when he'll come back after his surgery.

Juan Espino (40). Great grappler. A tad old, but the talent is there.

Alexander Romanov (30). A gargantuan tank of a man with a background in sumo. If he can shore up his striking fundamentals, learn to check kicks and defend against punches I have high Hope's for this young man.

Tom Aspinall (27). Big Liverpoollian (correct spelling Liverpudlian but I was close) with fast, sharp boxing. Was a training partner of Tyson Fury, now trains at the same gym as Darren Till. He's very promising but still green (jumps way back like a typical mma fighter as defense for anything, not a sign of elite level striking yet). His wrestling defense may need some work too as his only legit loss was from being held down for 2 rounds.

Chris Daukus (31) I remain skeptical. In his last fight he slimmed down to 227, a weight not uncommon for light heavyweights but he still looked very out of shape. Last time I saw someone that light at heavyweight it was Mark Godbeer and Adam Milstead and we all know what happened to Milstead (against Blaydes). The speed advantage that comes with being light may work at lower ranks but... well, we shall see.

**Exciting** (yay!)

Now that I mention it, this is filled with everyone I'll tune in to see fight. Some are legit exciting, some I am interested in, and some I just want to see win.

Lins (PFL HW tournament winner). Hardy (yeh). Greene (hes not very good but seeing him win makes me happy). Sherman (I love his fight with Rashad Coulter, funniest shit I've ever seen). Carlos Felipe (his last fight was pretty darn good). Parker Porter (a true super athlete). Todd Duffee (is he still alive?) and Gustafsson and Latifi, two men I'd like to see again and that's it foe this essay.",Suprising State of The Heavyweight Division,58,1

All below are thoughts or quotes from Rashad:

**Kamaru is strong. He feel like Harambe.** 

How is Kamaru’s submission defence? 

**One of the first fights I cornered Kamaru in he got rear naked choke. It was actually Bruce Leroy alex Caceres’ brother. So after that he worked very hard, Kamaru focused a lot on the jiu jitsu just the gi training. immersed himself in the submissions and defending them**

What kind of wrestler is Kamaru? 

**He is a chain wrestler. He’ll chain multiple different takedowns together after you defend one he’s already thinking about the second and the third** 

**He knows how to adapt that to mma from college wrestling, the expenditure of energy. He knows when to let go of a shot.**

The systemic training of Kamaru Usman

**Rashad had to teach Kamaru to not train so hard pretty much cause you can only do that for so long before your body starts breaking down. Kamaru saw every training session as a chance to improve. He would come 30-40 minutes before every class just to warm up and stretch. Keep in mind when class started we would warm up as a team too** 

Rashad prefers Usman in orthodox stance (left foot forward, right hand back) as he feels Kamaru is “more defensively responsible”. 

How he first met Kamaru? 

**King Mo Lawal introduced Kamaru to Rashad. Rashad was training for Rampage Jackson and hurt his hamstring, so he couldn’t do much but drill. So Kamaru was one of his main drilling partners (pause)**

**Kamaru was known as a wrestler at the time training with the Olympic training center. Rashad says Kamaru tried turning up the pace on him the first time they met/trained, but Rashad had to shut that down. He said with a smile and Kamaru would have a different take.** 

Size difference between Gilbert Burns and Usman:

**It use to be a lot more pronounced. Aesthetically Kamaru may look much bigger but I think gilbert has closed the gap a good deal. Grown into the weight class.**

I’m not an expert in fighting at all, let alone grappling, but this issue (arguably more aesthetic than practical) is interesting to me. 

I understand that Kamaru is an attritional fighter who wants to wear you out to gain advantage in the later rounds, and, unlike Colby who emphasizes volume, Kamaru emphasizes control on the ground and in the clinch. Naturally, he will fight at a slower pace. 

I also think, just from observation, that it’s difficult to maintain a massive amount and take as many opportunities for transitions or damage as possible. He’s often compared to Khabib, who is perceived as much more entertaining for this reason. However, I think what made Khabib one of the greatest wrestlers to ever compete is his ability to do this. The ability to exploit all of your opponents openings while keeping all of yours tight is beyond elite level skill, and I don’t think Kamaru is quite that good.

Kamaru certainly isn’t incapable of inflicting damage. I think his fight with RDA is the best example of this. He put quite the beat down on him in every position except standing. Also, all of his fight show a clear favor to working the body. Even in the Colby fight (which, again, was an unconventional fight for Kamaru) Kamaru worked the body quite a bit with his kicks and that paid off up quite well against a complete cardio monster. Body strikes tend to have a bigger impact through stamina than damage, which fits right into his game.

With all of this in mind, I think the real question is this: **Does Kamaru’s lack of volume at optimal moments go beyond the point of risk?**

Obviously a gameplan is a gameplan, and if I was a fighter’s coach, I would never advocate for a fighter to take actions that increased the risk of losing unless absolutely necessary. But comparing the RDA fight to the Masvidal fight, I wonder if the reason he didn’t do much damage to Masvidal is because he simply couldn’t control him as well. Masvidal is a very dangerous striker that also can defend well both in the clinch and on the ground. Kamaru might have thought that trying too hard to hurt Masvidal would give just a small enough opening to escape and put Kamaru in a striking situation, which was clearly to his disadvantage. This makes plenty of sense.

Much of the criticism, however, implies that Kamaru exerts enough control over his opponents that activity shouldn’t be a huge risk and therefore the lack there of is inexcusable.",Is there a technical explanation for Kamaru Usman’s lack of volume/activity in optimal positions beyond risk?,86,1

1. Usman v. Burns
2. Maycee Barber v. Alexa Grasso
3. [Miranda Maverick v. Gillian Robertson](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/lgeh8j/utilizing_data_science_and_analytics_on_miranda/)

If you missed out on my breakdown last week of [Alistair Overeem vs. Alexander Volkov](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/ldi123/utilizing_data_science_and_analytics_to_analyze/) or [Miranda Maverick v. Gillian Robertson](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/lgeh8j/utilizing_data_science_and_analytics_on_miranda/), here is a little context of what I am doing. To create the following analysis, I watched every fight of the two fighters that I pulled data from and mixed my own visual analysis with statistical breakdowns I created for the two fighters. Statistical analytics were drawn from my Judging Model as well as my new Fighter Accumulated Strategy and Tactics (FAST) models (first article coming this Saturday). I will be breaking down each fighter's past high level strategy and specific fight tactics and then investigate their ratings based upon their round win % as determined by the Judging Model.

Next up, Maycee Barber vs. Alexa Grasso.

**Visual Scouting:**

I am going to start my visual scouting with Alexa Grasso. Grasso profiles as a technical boxer with a focus on keeping her opponent at distance to steadily whittle them down. Grasso has a fantastic jab - straight combo that she uses largely as a weapon to win points victories. I have not seen next level power out of Grasso in any of my visual scouting fights. In her fight vs Heather Clark, she stunned Clark on a high kick because Clark lunged and took a flush knee to the side of the head. Grasso was unable to seal the TKO because her style lacks the power flourish to really put away a hurt opponent with a TKO. I see Grasso as a highly effective point fighter with limited finishing capability which caps her upside in the loaded flyweight class.

Enough negativity though, where is the potential? Grasso has incredible scrambling skills. I regularly, audibly yelled at my tv in amazement at some of the scrambles she won. I have no one I can compare her to because her scrambling skills are just so unique. The problem, she relies a bit too heavily on the scrambling and sometimes her take down defense technique suffers accordingly. I do not see that as an achilles heel though, I see a couple specific improvements that would override this tendency and make her a better finisher. I think that Grasso should metaphorically steer into the skid by leveraging her scrambling skills and turning them into chances for submissions. I specifically kept thinking she could throw killer guillotine chokes a la Dustin Poirier.

Dustin regularly chooses to throw guillotine chokes at the expense of technique in take down defense but raises his chances for finishing his opponent in equal measure. Alexa’s command of the scramble likely means that she has the potential to be an immense guillotine threat. This would dissuade Gillian Robertson-esque fighters from attempting to take her down. Adding the guillotine would also make her a superior distance fighter. How you may ask? I, like many others, view MMA fights as a game of chess. The guillotine choke has been used by skilled distance fighters over and over in the past (Poirier and Overeem as two examples) to put even more fear of entering the pocket against them. Grasso’s game is predicated on distance but she lacks the power to scare opponents like Carla Esparza from entering the pocket and then attempting a takedown on her. Taking away your opponents weapons and augmenting your own is the key to winning and moving up in MMA.

Now onto Maycee Barber. My notes on Barber read like a baseball scouting report of a slugging third baseman. “Natural power, does not sell out on strikes”, “Power comes naturally”, “Can really hear the pop when she hits”. Barber is an anomaly when it comes to fighters in her weight class. She has an insanely high finish %: 100% of her four victories come by finish. She achieves these finishes through power striking and truly NASTY elbows in the clinch and on the ground. Maycee is a problem for the women’s flyweight division.

The most important thing about Maycee, and I will again reference baseball, is my first quote above: “Natural power, does not sell out on strikes”. Maycee isn’t swinging for the bleachers on every punch. She stays within herself and strikes naturally but turns it up when she smells blood in the water. Maycee stylistically strikes like a point fighter but is able to push her power up two extra gears simply by nature of her natural talent. This is a sign that she has further room to grow as a striker purely by nature of gaining more cage experience. I repeat again: Maycee is a PROBLEM. If her distance management skills improve, her overall striking game will (in my opinion) be top 2-3 flyweight tier.

My one specific area of improvement for Maycee, she needs to throw her kicks at the end of a combo. I saw, in multiple fights, skilled strikers would hit her with a hard jab to the jaw when she would throw kicks with no lead up. If she attempts this vs Grasso, she has the opportunity to get hit with clean, flush shots to her head.

**Data Analysis:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Offensive Strategic Class**|**Number of Rounds**|**Win %**|**% of Total Rounds**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|4|75%|57.1%|
|Balanced Grappler|2|100%|28.6%|
|Grappling Heavy|1|0%|14.3%|

What I find interesting above is I essentially can’t draw anything from the above efficiency numbers. Why? The only rounds Maycee has lost was against Roxanne Modafferi where Barber tore her ACL in the first and continued fighting another 14.5 minutes. Otherwise Barber has won every round she's ever fought. I can however draw conclusions on what she is likely to do in this fight. 6 out of 7 of her rounds were Striking Heavy or Balanced Striking. I project she gets into a firefight with Grasso.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class**|**Number of Rounds**|**Win %**|**% of Total Rounds**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|3|100%|42.9%|
|Grappling Heavy|3|33%|42.9%|
|Balanced Striker|1|100%|14.3%|

By the same token as above, not much to discern from these win % numbers but let's look at how fighters approach her. All three of the Grappling Heavy rounds were Roxanne Modaferri so let’s throw those out for now. 75% of the time, fighters choose to stand and strike with Barber. Based on Grasso’s tendencies, I expect that number to increase this weekend.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Offensive Strategic Class**|**Number of Rounds**|**Win %**|**% of Total Rounds**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|13|62%|68.4%|
|Balanced Striker|5|80%|26.3%|
|Balanced Grappler|1|100%|5.3%|

Out of Grasso’s 19 rounds, 18 were either Striking Heavy or Balanced Striking. This, again, tells me this is going to be a full on standup showcase between these two fighters. My models have Grasso winning 61.5% of her Striking Heavy rounds which statistically leaves her open to losing on points to Barber as well who wins at a 100% clip (on a much more limited sample size).

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class**|**Number of Rounds**|**Win %**|**% of Total Rounds**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|12|83%|63.2%|
|Balanced Grappler|3|33%|15.8%|
|Balanced Striker|3|67%|15.8%|
|Grappling Heavy|1|0%|5.3%|

Here’s the main key, Grasso is fantastic when defending against Striking Heavy fighters. She wins these rounds at a clip of 83.3% my model says. Statistically, the path to victory against Grasso is mixing in grappling and making it hard for Grasso to keep you at distance. Maycee’s clinch game and specifically her elbows will make it tough for Grasso to keep her at distance.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Offensive Strategic Class**|**Offensive Tactical Class**|**Number of Rounds**|**Win %**|**% of Total Rounds**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|Head Hunter|3|67%|42.9%|
|Striking Heavy|Tree Chopper|1|100%|14.3%|
|Balanced Grappler|Clinch|1|100%|14.3%|
|Balanced Grappler|High Output|1|100%|14.3%|
|Grappling Heavy|Ground and Pound|1|100%|14.3%|

Sample sizes are of course small because Barber is a finisher but she profiles as a balanced all around stand up fighter tactically.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class**|**Defensive Tactical Class**|**Number of Rounds**|**Win %**|**% of Total Rounds**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|Head Hunter|2|100%|28.6%|
|Grappling Heavy|Head Hunter|2|50%|28.6%|
|Striking Heavy|Balanced|1|100%|14.3%|
|Balanced Striker|High Output Head Hunter|1|100%|14.3%|
|Grappling Heavy|Ground and Pound|1|0%|14.3%|

Lots of head hunting against Barber. I believe this is because most of these fighters are coached to try and get Barber out of the cage as quickly as possible. Her power is so overwhelming, you have to find a way to break through and test her chin.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Offensive Strategic Class**|**Offensive Tactical Class**|**Number of Rounds**|**Win %**|**% of Total Rounds**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|Head Hunter|12|67%|63.2%|
|Balanced Striker|High Output Head Hunter|3|67%|15.8%|
|Balanced Striker|Clinch|2|100%|10.5%|
|Striking Heavy|Balanced|1|0%|5.3%|
|Balanced Grappler|High Output|1|100%|5.3%|

Again, we are seeing statistical backing of Grasso as a distance boxer. She is overwhelmingly a Striking Heavy Head Hunter.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class**|**Defensive Tactical Class**|**Number of Rounds**|**Win %**|**% of Total Rounds**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|Head Hunter|9|78%|47.4%|
|Striking Heavy|Balanced|3|100%|15.8%|
|Balanced Striker|High Output Head Hunter|3|67%|15.8%|
|Balanced Grappler|High Output|2|50%|10.5%|
|Balanced Grappler|Ground and Pound|1|0%|5.3%|
|Grappling Heavy|Ground and Pound|1|0%|5.3%|

Interestingly, we are seeing a broad approach to fighting Grasso with varying degrees of success. What I am most interested in, statistically we are seeing that fighters are attempting volume approaches to attacking Grasso. Most likely trying to tire her out. This seems to be moderately effective because she wins those combined rounds at a rate of 60% compared to 77.8% of Striking Heavy Head Hunting.

You may notice that I have less statistical analysis writing above. This is largely due to Barber’s lack of cage time (so many finishes) coupled with some specific data cleanliness issues: tearing her ACL immediately vs Modafferi.

**Conclusion:**

This is, for me, the most exciting fight on the card this weekend. Barber and Grasso are both incredible fighters and I see this being a really competitive and interesting fight to watch. I conclude that Barber has many more paths to victory than Grasso. Similar to the Volkov v Overeem fight last week, Grasso has a single path to victory. She needs to thread the needle of keeping Barber at distance while scoring enough points to win a decision victory. I think the more likely outcome is that Barber overpowers Grasso in the clinch doing more and more damage leading to a KO/TKO or a points victory. I never really saw Grasso’s chin tested so I am not sure how she will do against Barber’s power advantage. The previous fact is why I can’t make a definitive call KO/TKO or points so I will just leverage both and say it's one of the two.

I predict a win by Barber via KO/TKO or Points.","1. Maycee Barber vs Alexa Grasso, Data Science Breakdown",33,1

I hope you guys find this as interesting as I did! I am also very open to criticism from the community!

**Logic:**

In order to better break down fights, I came up with the idea of separating out the overall strategic and tactical approaches fighters take per round. This article is going to be on the strategic aspect of my FAST models with further articles to come on the four tactical models

So, as any data scientist will tell you, I started my project off with a question. What defines a fighter’s strategy. In my opinion, a fighter’s strategy is broadly where they CHOOSE (keyword here is choose) to spend their time in the cage. For example, Masvidal did not choose to be in the bottom position against Usman. Usman made that choice for him. Masvidal wanted to stand and strike with Usman to try and knock him out. So now we intuitively have a broad measure of strategic approach: how much time does a fighter spend in a position they chose to go to. To convert this idea to a quantitative measure I broke it down into 3 measurable categories: standing time, control time, and controlled time. Controlled time is equal to their opponents control time for that round and standing time is equal to total round time minus control time and controlled time. Ufcstats.com thankfully has total round time and control time so I was able to simply create these stats with the data from my data warehouse.

**Math:**

So now we have our three quantitative measures but we run into the problem of differing amounts of round time. We need to be able to compare a round that ends in 2:30 to a full round (5:00). The model I use is sensitive to the differences in raw round totals so we need to convert them to ratios. So next up, I merged back in our fourth measure: total round time. This measure is equal to the sum of the previous three measures (all of these measures are in seconds).

To account for these changes and make them comparable, I divided the first three measures by the fourth to get % of time standing, % of time in control and % of time controlled. Since we want only time the fighter chose, we are focused on the first two of the above three.

**Modeling and Results:**

I used a K means clustering algorithm to look for differentiation between the two measures (in machine learning we call them features which is what I will call them going forward). I don’t want to go too math heavy to explain how the algorithm works but at a high level the model looks for clusters of similar rounds and labels them as such. I then look at the statistics of those rounds and come to a conclusion about what they are.

I utilized traditional methods for choosing the number of clusters in the K Means (elbow method) and came to the conclusion that 4 clusters was the best choice. For those data science enthusiasts out there, my cosine k means score was .827 which shows a high level of differentiation.

Now the results. To get the below table I did a simple pivot table grouping by the cluster label and then averaged the two input features (% of time standing and % of time in control) to see what the average round looked like for each.

| **Class** | **Strategic Class** | **% of time in control** | **% of time standing** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|0|Striking Heavy|3%|76.4%|
|1|Balanced Grappler|42.5%|36.8%|
|2|Balanced Striker|23.2%|54.8%|
|3|Grappling Heavy|68.3%|16.5%|

 As we can see:

The 0th class spent 76.4% of their time standing with 3% of their time in control. I labeled this class the Striking Heavy class.

The 1st class is 42.5% control and 36.8% standing so I called this the Balanced Grappler class.

The 2nd class had 54.8% standing and 23.2% control so I called this the Balanced Striker class.

The 3rd class had 68.3% control and 16.5% standing so I called this the Grappling Heavy class.

**Conclusion:**

As I explained to my manager on a project I did for work using K Means clustering: unsupervised clustering algorithms give a math answer that I, the data scientist, interpret into a business (or in this case MMA) answer. As such, these results are open to tons of speculation and scrutiny and I welcome any and all questions on this! I am very open to updating my models and data warehouse based on correct critiques and I am also open to any and all questions regarding the above methods!",How I am using unsupervised machine learning to investigate MMA strategy,52,1

I'm  thinking about purchasing Fight Pass and wanted to have a playlist of  your top fights, too many fighters I don't know and I could use some  guidance.

I grew up on George  St.Pierre and the Spider, so those years hold a special place, but I  feel like I'm missing out on some legendary brawls.

I hope everyone is doing well! Wanted to update you guys on some ELO before the fights Tonight, sorry its a bit late!.

For reference to what elo is and how these ratings were derived, please see my [previous posts](https://old.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/gxjyr8/mma_elo_preufc_250_nunes_vs_spencer/).

Elo is a rating that can be useful at looking at strength of record. Points are given and taken depending on the opponents rating at the time, a win over a higher rated opponent yields more points, where a loss would lose fewer. Ratings were generated by scraping the Sherdog fight database and retroactively applying the formula for wins, losses and draws.

These ratings hold some weight to record, for instance: Take Conor McGregor with a record of 22W / 5L and Julio Cesar Neves jr has a record of 35W/ 1L Conors Rating is 1757 Julios rating is 1534

By only looking at record, Conor McGregor would not appear to be better rated, but he has faced competition with better records so his score comes in higher, than Julio who has faced competition with lower ratings.

\------------------------------------------

Since the Main Event is in the Welterweight division, Lets take a look at that divisions top fighters

|Rank|Name|Rating|
:--|:--|:--|
|1|Kamaru-Usman-120691|1922.77|

|10|Stephen-Thompson-59608|1687.69|
|11|Santiago-Ponzinibbio-64593|1671.67|


Here are the ratings and a few notes on some of the more interesting match-ups:

|Name|ELO_x_x|exp_score_x|PtsForwin|EloForwin|

|Gilbert Burns|1796.1|0.33|67.46|1863.56|


Kamaru is number 1 at Welterweight  and 4th overall and Gilbert is number 2 and 19th overall,  a winfor kamaru Keeps him at the top of the division and keeps him at 4th overall. 
A win for Burns  Takes 67 points from Kamaru and Burns would then be at the top of the division

I try to keep an updated spreadsheet with the current rating and their highest rating, and average ELO of opponents.

I update the UFC and important Bellator matches pretty regularly, everything else gets updated a little later. This is a little difficult because of the cancelled fight cards due to Covid, any reccomendations on how to update a bit more regularly would be appreciated. 

From my estimate, these scores are 90% accurate, I'm going through each fighter manually and checking how the code worked out, with fighters at 50+ fights i am usually missing about 1 fight, because of covid, i am missing some of the more recent local and smaller promotions. I double check with Tapology from time to time to ensure accuracy and capture additional amateur matches.
I've added a separate tabs for division fighters

Always open for questions on how this was put together and any comments on improvements.
With the pandemic, its tougher to get accurate records from sherdog, so I am also looking for help on maintaining a solid database of fights to get the most accurate results, my thoughts are maybe putting a small group together to keep an updated database any comments on how to do this would be appreciated.

&amp;#x200B;

What's up guys, I'm back once again to play matchmaker after yet another PPV. In my first installment of this series, I broke down UFC 251, and its winners and losers. Kamaru Usman was originally scheduled to fight Gilbert Burns, but after Burns contracted COVID, he was replaced with Jorge Masvidal on short notice. Now that Kamaru finally got the Gilbert Burns chapter out of the way, the welterweight picture is much more clear for the 170 landscape. I will take a close look at three bouts, and where those fighters should be going from here, and I will speed through the rest of the fighters before I get to the top three bouts. Here we go...

&amp;#x200B;

W - Gabe Green: Takashi Sato

L - Phil Rowe: Jared Gooden

W - Chris Gutierrez: Marlon Vera or Said Nurmagomedov

L - Andre Ewell: Jack Shore

W - Polyana Viana: Randa Markos

L - Mallory Martin: Felice Herrig

W - Belal Muhammad: Li Jingliang

L - Dhiego Lima: Alex Morono

W - Anthony Hernandez (holy shit): Alessio Di Chirico or Brendan Allen 

L - Rodolfo Vieira: Deron Winn

W - Julian Marquez: Karl Roberson

L - Maki Pitolo: Jack Marshman

W - Ricky Simon: Merab Dvalishvili (I love this matchup, both have incredible pacing)

L - Brian Kelleher: Nathaniel Wood

&amp;#x200B;

Fight #1: Kelvin Gastelum vs. Ian Heinisch

RESULT: Gastelum defeats Heinisch via unanimous decision

&amp;#x200B;

Kelvin Gastelum - Jared Cannonier? Brad Tavares?

For the first time in two years, Kelvin Gastelum is in the win column, after suffering a disheartening stretch losing three tough fights in a row. Gastelum displayed his wrestling against his opponent, Heinisch in order to dictate the fight in his favor. With this important win in the bag for Gastelum, it is honestly unclear where he goes from here. The rest of the top middleweights are busy at the moment, and I'm not sure if Gastelum is in the position to make a move up the rankings list. The only fighter that seems to be available is Jared Cannonier, and I don't think that fight is good for either right now. Cannonier lost to Robert Whittaker, and despite having his orbital fractured, and arm broken, he won a round against the Australian. Cannonier might tangle with someone closer to the top than that of Kelvin Gastelum. However, the fight between these two could possibly be a good one on paper. Another opponent is Brad Tavares. Tavares recently defeated Antonio Carlos Junior in January to retain his spot in the middleweight rankings. Tavares looked improved from his back to back losses at the hands of Adesanya, and Shahbazyan, and he looks to potential be a factor once again at 185. Gastelum-Tavares could shape up to be a solid bout.

&amp;#x200B;

Ian Heinisch: Sean Strickland

&amp;#x200B;

Ian Heinisch was simply outworked by Kelvin Gastelum tonight. KG scored six takedowns, and Heinisch was controlled for nearly 7 out of 15 total minutes in the bout. It's not quite Heinisch's time yet, but now he could be due for an entertaining bout. Sean Strickland's comeback is nothing short of miraculous. After being out of MMA for two years due to a motorcycle crash, Strickland returned with two bouts in two weeks, beating Jack Marshman, and then surprisingly Brendan Allen by TKO. These feats by Strickland are more than deserving for him to get a shot at the rankings, and Ian Heinisch with his style of fighting, and Factory X Muay Thai background, could make this a bonus level bout.

&amp;#x200B;

Fight #2: Maycee Barber vs. Alexa Grasso

RESULT: Alexa Grasso defeats Maycee Barber via unanimous decision

&amp;#x200B;

Alexa Grasso: Antonina Shevchenko

Grasso defeated Barber despite being a narrow favorite on the betting line, thanks to her high striking IQ, and fighting capabilities, which outclassed the young Maycee Barber in the co-main event. Maybe Grasso could get the sister of 125 lb champ Antonina to face in a duel. Both a ranked in the teens column of this division, and both have really interesting striking backgrounds. It could be an intriguing bout for MMA fans to watch.

&amp;#x200B;

Maycee Barber: Taila Santos

Unfortunately for Maycee Barber, the future looks a bit uncertain. Yes, she still has a ton of potential, but Barber has a ton to work on if she'll ever become champion. Thankfully, age is on her side, because not only is Barber on the right side of 30, she's on the right side of freaking 25. With Barber's swarming style on the feet, I think that the Future would be best suited to face Taila Santos, who has 10 KOs in 17 victories of her MMA career. Santos was raised by a father who was a Muay Thai instructor, and this influence would help get her into the sport, and eventually into the UFC. Santos' muay thai style, and Barber's aggressiveness could make for a wild striking clinic.

&amp;#x200B;

Fight #3: Kamaru Usman vs. Gilbert Burns

RESULT: Kamaru Usman defeats Gilbert Burns in Round 3 via TKO

&amp;#x200B;

Kamaru Usman: Winner of Covington-Edwards, or Winner of Covington-Masvidal

Kamaru Usman's performance from tonight was far from boring, as Usman and Burns fought like they owed each other money for just over 10 minutes. After a round of rock em sock em, Usman started to gain serious control, and after a few huge hits, the Nigerian knocked down his former teammate with a stiff right hand, which marked the beginning of the end in Vegas. Kamaru Usman is a dominant force, and one who has a small chance of becoming the top P4P fighter in the world by the end of the year. Yes, I know, if you look back on my post history, you'll see me ripping on Usman for his lack luster performance against Jorge Masvidal last July, but there's a possibility that these two face again in an appropriate rematch given the circumstances of COVID, and short notice weight cutting for Masvidal. depending on who Colby Covington fights, whether its Leon or Masvidal will completely pave the way for who the next opponent for Usman will be. If Leon pulls the upset over Covington in a hypothetical matchup, then we must respect Leon and give him his rematch against Usman, because it would be crazy if Edwards beat Covington. However, there is still money to be made from a bad blood battle between Covington and Masvidal. Hold on for dear life, because that one will be crazy. Expect Usman to face one of those three fighters in the late summer to early fall.

&amp;#x200B;

Gilbert Burns: Stephen Thompson, or Michael Chiesa?

Tough break for Burns. After showing some surprising, and explosive moments, the Brazilian was unable to finish his former teammate, and was instead finished by a stiff straight, followed by heavy ground and pound. Gilbert Burns is still a fantastic grappler, and maybe a bout against Michael Chiesa could be an interesting chess match on the mats between the two former lightweight standouts. Both fighters have wreaked havoc on the division since entering, and both would have a sick grappling battle. If Burns doesn't face Chiesa, then maybe give him Thompson, who is eager to return to the octagon for another title run, this summer. Burns would have a to really second guess himself in a bout with Thompson who is as great as a striker can come. Gilbert Burns will bounce back, but with his older age of 34, I don't know if he'll get a second shot at Usman in the near future.

**Petition for John Morgan to stop asking the first questions during UFC pressers**

Journalism is pivotal for covering sport, gives the company, the person being asked the questions and the journalist a chance to voice their views. I know it’s become a bit of a joke with John Morgan ALWAYS asking the first question. 

**It shuts out other journalists questions** The problem with having John always asking the first question is that it shuts out other journalists for answering pivotal questions and giving a fair platform to said other journalists to setup a better career or just gain general experience. They may even ask the same question with a different way of saying it and getting a completely different insight. It wouldn’t matter if he was first a few times. But FOR EVERY FIGHTER AND DANA HIMSELF HE ALWAYS is first with his set questions. He’s invaluable in that sense because his positive company endearing style of journalism is to set a ufc-positive tone, which leads into the second point and last main point:

**He’s a UFC company man** John Morgan is a UFC man through and through. Which isn’t a bad thing of course,  but biased questioning has always played a key roll in his success for reporting in the UFC. Since he’s always first to question he naturally gets the most airtime. But his inability to ask hard questions due to his position is one sided. For example , for what made Ariel Helwani stand out in his career is that he asked the hard questions, and was generally a very non-biased reporter. John only asks questions that’s in the UFC’s best interests. 

I understand that he’s been reporting MMA for a long time, since 2007 I believe and is very well knowledgeable and highly regarded within the general MMA scene for the reasons stated above. In my opinion there really should be a stepping-aside for himself and let some new journalists find their ground setting tones for the pressers. I understand that it’s not fully his part for the way he conducts his questioning, MMAJUNKIE (whom he reports for) and the UFC holds him on a pedestal which he can fall of quite easily.",Petition for John Morgan to stop asking the first question,51,1

It was enough for me to wonder how good Usman's jab was in his previous fights and exactly how much Wittman changed it. Went back and watched parts of the [fight with Covington.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSE9-GDHyX4)

To my surprise, it seems not much has changed for Usman. The form of his jab was always good, straight, not too much in the way of tells. His straight was also good, he switches stances and fights southpaw. He wings his hooks and overhands a bit much but otherwise everything seems on point, as it is in the Burns fight, so what made his jab so damn effective in this fight, what did Trevor Wittman change, and were those changes specifically done to combat Burns?

From what I can guess/observe, against Covington he used the jab like anyone else would, he puts it out there, uses it to try and set up his straight or hook, he switches stances to give a different look/put his power hand up front. When he gets caught he starts throwing/winging hooks. Against Burns, from what I remember, Usman tightened up the jab and turned it into a stiff jab that he would throw out to stun/hurt Burns and keep the pressure off. No longer is it there to set up a straight or a hook, the jab was the damage dealer, and used to cut off Burn's hooks. Otherwise, a lot of the things mentioned seems to be the same as when he fought Colby. 

Question I have is whether this style of heavy jab is something he did specifically for Burns, or whether he is going to keep it for later fights, because it was damn impressive to see?

Thoughts? Am I seeing things correctly or am I full of shit? Linked UFC's free fight with Covington above for anyone who wants to take a look.",Usman's Jab?,32,1

Last night Kamaru surpassed GSP’s 12 fight winning streak by beating Gilbert Burns and notching his 13th win; however one key factor is being left out in this discussion, title fights.

GSP had a 12 fight winning streak, which when left at that is definitely overwritten last night with a Kamaru win over Burns, but what is most incredible is that GSP’s 12 fight winning streak took place entirely in title fights. I think this is a very big note that is getting missed in this discussion as it speaks volumes regarding opponent quality and pressure during those fights. 

To me, most non-title fights have just a little less  pressure and intensity to them, not to mention opponent quality. So I wanted to ask you all, how do you rank Kamaru’s current winning streak given that a large part of it was while he climbing the ranks, versus GSP who notched 12 straight title fight victories?",[Discussion] How do we rank Kamaru Usman’s winning streak versus GSP’s?,1,1

* Micheal Chandler silences critics with the best possible debut a fighter could ask for: a one-punch KO against an iron-chinned Dan Hooker.

* Dustin Poirier becomes the first person to knockout Conor McGregor is ready to reap all the rewards and attention from it.

* Cory Sandhagen knocks out Frankie Edgar, an absolute legend, with a beautiful flying knee and establishes himself as an absolute killer in a sipe-stacked bantamweight division.

* Alexander Volkov similarly made himself a super dangerous contender in the heavyweight division after beating down Alistair Overreem

* And last night, Kamaru Usman finally gains the respect I’ve been so wishing for with his performance against Burns.

Then after he beat Till it almost seemed like the debate was settled that Woodley had surpassed GSP. Woodley’s title reign consisted of a draw vs WB, beating WB (In a terrible fight that he arguably lost) stuffing takedowns against Maia in another terrible fight and then beating overhyped Till. Usman dominated Woodley 5 months after he beat Till but apparently Woodley got old and out of his prime in the spam of 5 months. Has now beat Colby, Jorge, and Burns and everyone is on the same page as far as he hasn’t surpassed GSP. ( Which I agree with) Why do you think the media created that narrative about Woodley but not Usman?

Too often we see fighters prolong their fight careers much past their prime based on the need to fight as they don't have anything else to fall back on and many lack financial expertise to invest appropriately early in their careers. 

Sam brought up a good friend of his in Spencer Fisher as a great example of why the UFC should support their fighters medically Post fight career. While medical support is fantastic, even providing a basic living income in their retirement would help set up fighters for success.

The example I brought up to Sam was the MLB. I realize it is hard to compare both organizations as the MLB is of course much larger and has a fantastic players union that supports their players. Nonetheless, the MLB provides access to a basic pension plan starting at 43games of service time and provides access to a full pension of min 68K once they hit 10years of service time.

Sam mentioned that those bigger leagues currently returns roughly 50% of income back to their players while UFC only does about 13%...

When Sam started back in 2005, he was only paid 2K to show up and 2K to Win (Don't worry he was given a $500 bonus for such a crazy performance, Fisher Vs Stout is still a top 50 Fight all time). While they do pay the fighters considerably more nowadays, the business has grown for being worth a few million to nowadays easily hitting 10Billion after the ESPN deal.

In my opinion, if the UFC wants to avoid unionization, they need to give something more to the fighters. A basic pension, would be a step in the right direction. I am not saying they should be rich but providing a basic wage to allow fighters to not push their limits and put their health at risk would go a long way!

What did however shock me and legitimately made me cry, was the reaction that Gilbert Burns had when he lost. 



You always see fighters get a bit emotional when losing, especially during a title fight, but the way Gilbert Burns reacted to that loss was so fucking sad to witness. The only other person that has made me feel that way after a loss in recent memory was Walt Harris, due to the circumstances. 



Not sure if the reason I feel this way is because you don't tend to see fighters especially, show themselves to be that vulnerable in the way that Gilbert Burns ended up doing during this loss.

I could’ve gotten some of these wrong, please let me know if I did since I don’t wanna be spreading false info

1. Holloway has the longest divisional win streak at 14. This basically means that Holloway has the longest winning streak at a single division.

He won 14 in at row up at featherweight until he lost to Volkanovski

2. Silva is the only person to surpass 13 wins. Everyone else either lost (a decision), retired, or got caught for drugs and was overturned to a NC

3. Including all of Zuffa, Aldo has the longest at 15, which also breaks Holloway’s record for the longest divisional win streak. (Holloway’s is UFC only though, and this isn’t)

4. If we include all of Zuffa, but limit it to undefeated streak (NC and draws don’t break it), then Jones is the new leader, at 17 officially, but realistically 16 cuz reyes.

On the other hand, there are so many fighters who found success at a higher weight class for which they don't have to cut a lot of weight. Examples: RDA, Whittaker, Gilbert Burns, Rumble, Poirier, C. Oliveira, Cejudo, Thiago Santos, Chiesa, Masvidal and probably many more. Alright, some of them got older and it was tougher to cut weight. But still, you hear so much about examples.

And also, you have fighters who thought going down was a good idea, but weren't really successful there: Jose Aldo, Anthony Pettis (LW -&gt; FW), Michael Johnson, Barboza, TJ Dillashaw.

Are these examples not enough to completely reconsider big weight cuts?","What do you think, is it generally easier to fight at smaller weight classes?",105,1

I recently made friends with a former champion fighter from Jordan named Tariq Hamdi. He was on the reality TV show “Desert Force” as well as several fights under the franchise name. 

I am looking for one fight in particular that has been removed from the arabsmma website. I am hoping someone here may have a copy/recording of it. Or could perhaps point me in the right direction. Believe me when I say I have searched the internet extensively for this fight, in both Arabic and English. Rumor has it that it was deliberately removed from the internet at the request of the fighter who lost the match. 

It took place August 18, 2015 in Beirut, Lebanon at the Ghazir Stadium. Desert Force 18 - Tariq (also posted sometimes at Tareq, Tarek) Hamdi (Hamdy) vs. Abdul Ahad (aka Abdulahad) Gari. It premiered on the channel MBA Action.

I’ve heard the arguments for each, I’ve witnessed the evidence unfold in the octagon in each of their careers, and  all three hold stats and achievements worthy of being in the GOAT discussion. Having said all of that, I think the fact that we are having such widespread debate is precisely why none of them are ready to be called GOATs yet. In my mind the status of GOAT isn’t as simple as being undefeated, number of title defenses, who you’ve beaten, etc. To be clear though, those are all legitimate factors but GOAT status is so much more than that. Those factors don’t fully mean GOAT until those factors have created the perception in the vast majority of fans minds that there is one and only one clear winner of that status. In other words a GOAT needs to be undeniable, undebatable and have the general consensus. If we talk about GOATs in other sports what’s clear is that there isn’t much debate and for whatever debate does exist it is usually put to rest simply by the fact that the GOAT achieved the most important stats and achievements in their given sport at level which has yet to be surpassed. Micheal Jordan and his 6 rings (two three-peats) in a talent heavy era. Wayne Gretzky with 4 Stanley Cup wins, most goals scored in a career, and the only player to have ever averaged a goal game in one season (92 in 80 games). Floyd Mayweather and his 50-0 status with 26 being title fights. And as of lately Tom Brady and his 7 rings.

Each of those GOATs from other sports will have their naysayers but in the vast majority of viewers eyes they have transcended the sport in a way that was never thought to be possible. Any challenger of their status has a long road to get there and will have to achieve a new level of the impossible to ever truly take the throne. In my eyes the UFC simply doesn’t have an individual that has set the bar so high the next contender isn’t really in contention.

End of rant. What do you y’all think?

This really widened my vision on each division, and it also fueled my creativity for future matchmaking. So, without further a do, here are the 2021 UFC Grand Prix(s)



STRAW WEIGHT

(C) Zhang Weili vs #1 Rose Namajunas                 VS           #2 Joanna Jedrezjczyk vs #3 Yan Xiaonan

#5 Nina Ansaroff vs #11 Mackenzie Dern             VS           #6 Marina Rodriguez vs #8 Michelle Waterson

The Strawweight division is due for a massive 2021, and it appears that Rose Namajunas could be getting another shot at gold against Zhang Weili sooner rather than later. As for the next stage for one of those two, perhaps we could get a fight night between Joanna and Yan (not to be confused with Petr), to determine the next title shot. This fight is a fantastic one on paper. Joanna is one of the most accomplished strikers in the world, while Yan's style is extremely unorthodox, yet very technically skilled. Winner gets the title shot. Ansaroff-Dern is also a really good matchup, seeing one of the top contenders returning after pregnancy to face one of 2020's most productive fighters in Mackenzie Dern. Dern went 3-0 in 2020, with two submissions, and in her last bout with Virna Jandridoba, she showed very improved standup, and out dueled the fellow Brazilian. Winner could face either Marina Rodriguez, or Michelle Waterson. I personally thought that Rodriguez beat Carla Esparza last July, but two judges thought otherwise. Rodriguez proved odds makers wrong with a stunning TKO over Amanda Ribas last month. Her striking is definitely some of the best at 115, and it should matchup well with Michelle Waterson.



WOMEN'S FLYWEIGHT

(C) Valentina Shevchenko vs #1 Jessica Andrade        VS      #3 Lauren Murphy vs #6 Joanne Calderwood

\#2 Katlyn Chookagian vs #7 Viviane Araujo                VS      #4 Jennifer Maia vs #10 Alexa Grasso

There was really no clear way of illustrating a Grand Prix for the Women's Flyweight Division. It feels like every body has already fought everybody at this point. This is my logic on what you just read: Shevchenko's next fight is seemingly Jessica Andrade who TKO'd the then top contender Katlyn Chookagian, after narrowly losing to Rose Namajunas last July. Lauren Murphy got a win last October at UFC 254, and Joanne Calderwood re-entered the win column by defeating Jessica at 257 last month. This matchup makes the most sense for the two fighters going ahead. Katlyn Chookagian defeated Cynthia Calvillo via unanimous decision in what was a betting upset. Chookagian is 2-1 since her loss to Valentina, and she could be two fights away from another shot at gold, which may be more easily accessible if Valentina moves up in weight. Finally, Jennifer Maia against Alexa Grasso. Jennifer Maia managed to win a round against Valentina at UFC 255. In a bout where she was one of the biggest betting underdogs in combat sports history, that is pretty surprising. Maia's next bout could be Mexico's Alexa Grasso, who has won back to back bouts with her impressive striking. Maia deserves to be in the mix especially since she was able to finish Joanne Calderwood in the first round last August.

&amp;#x200B;

WOMEN'S BANTAMWEIGHT (3 options)

OPTION 1 - IF Shevchenko defeats Andrade

(C) Amanda Nunes vs (C-FLW) Valentina Shevchenko    VS   #1 Germaine de Randemie vs #2 Holly Holm

OPTION 2 - IF Andrade upsets Shevchenko

(C) Amanda Nunes vs #3 Aspen Ladd                        VS        #1 Germaine de Randemie vs #2 Holly Holm

OPTION 3 - IF Andrade upsets Shevchenko

(C) Amanda Nunes vs (C-FLW) Jessica Andrade        VS        #1 Germaine de Randemie vs #2 Holly Holm

As a quick disclaimer, a ton of things have to fall into place. First, Amanda Nunes must fight, and defeat Megan Anderson, who is her next opponent at 145. If she wins, then this Grand Prix is definitely going to happen. If she shockingly loses, then maybe Nunes rematches Anderson at 145, or fights Ladd at 135. But the biggest fight in Women's MMA to make is hands down Nunes-Shevchenko III. It's far and above the biggest challenge for both Nunes and Shevchenko, because it feels like no one in the galaxy can touch either one of them.

&amp;#x200B;

FLYWEIGHT

(C) Deiveson Figueiredo vs #1 Brandon Royval         VS         #2 Joseph Benavidez vs #3 Askar Askarov

This one is a bit iffy for me. If Benavidez wins at UFC 259, it's still going to take more than that to get a possible third shot at Figueiredo, if he can even get it. Possibly, if Benavidez got a spectacular KO, or an overwhelmingly dominant performance against Askarov, then maybe a trilogy bout with Figueiredo happens. But if Figgy loses, then Joe B could very well fight Brandon Moreno for the title as one final shot at gold. Moreno and Benavidez have yet to fight each other in their lengthy UFC careers, and if the odds are broken, and the pieces fall into their place, then maybe just maybe they could fight. In summary here's how it plays out: If Figueiredo and Benavidez win, then Figueiredo will face Moreno in a trilogy bout. If Figueiredo and Askarov win, then those two will fight later in 2021. If Moreno and Benavidez win, then those two will fight. And finally if Moreno and Askarov win, then you'll either see those two fight, or Moreno and Figgy face in a trilogy bout later in 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

BANTAMWEIGHT

(C) Petr Yan vs #1 Aljamain Sterling                          VS             #2 Cory Sandhagen

\#3 Rob Font vs T.J. Dillashaw                                      VS             #4 Cody Garbrandt vs #6 Jose Aldo

In a division that has seen it's fair share of total drama, and storylines, things will likely reach a boiling point when former bantamweight king, and USADA convict T.J. Dillashaw returns to the octagon. With everyone else in the division either busy, or vying for their shot, Dillashaw's best move is to fight Rob Font, who recently finished Marlon Moraes with a first round TKO. That would be a sweet co-main event to a PPV, potentially the McGregor-Poirier III card which is all but confirmed at the moment (I'll get to that in a sec). The only negative would be that Dillashaw and Garbrandt could potentially cross paths a third time with no belt on the line this time, thus evaporating any real PPV appeal for the company. Any matchup between Font, Dillashaw, Garbrandt, or Aldo would more than get the fans watching these fights. If only I had made this bracket earlier when Sandhagen and Edgar hadn't fought yet, then it would be a perfect 8 :(

&amp;#x200B;

FEATHERWEIGHT

(C) Alexander Volkanovski vs #2 Brian Ortega        VS               #1 Max Holloway

\#3 Zabit Magomedsharipov vs #5 Korean Zombie   VS            #4 Yair Rodriguez vs #6 Calvin Kattar

While a handful of the fighters in this segment haven't seen the light of day since before corona (literally) This division still has a lot to offer us. Max Holloway made it obvious that he's next to get a title shot after his other worldly win over Calvin Kattar which saw Holloway enter the damn Matrix in route to a violent, lopsided decision. If you're familiar with motivated McGregor, then this is what motivated Holloway looks like. As for the rest of the division, Zabit-TKZ is a good fight on paper, although it may be troublesome for the UFC to get Zabit out of the 19th century Oval Office, and back into a cage lololol. When Yair finishes his suspension for inactivity, the obvious next step for him is Calvin Katter, a man who had back to back striking clinics against Jeremy Stephens, and Dan Ige.

&amp;#x200B;

LIGHTWEIGHT (A bit murky)

\#1 Dustin Poirier vs #6 Conor McGregor                  VS        Khabib Nurmagomedov OR Charles Oliveira

\#2 Justin Gaethje vs #4 Michael Chandler                VS         ???

The lightweight division, while exciting is a bit unclear at the moment. If Khabib officially retires, then McGregor and Poirier will likely face off for the undisputed world title in May or June. The winner will then face Charles Oliveira for their first defense of the belt (which I think either one loses, because Oliveira is on a different level right now). However, if Khabib does not retire, then either Poirier or McGregor will fight the eagle later this year in a lucrative send off for Khabib that could shatter PPV records (especially if the rematch is 150 million vs 6 million if you know what I'm saying). As for Gaethje and Chandler, the winner of that sure fire banger will likely get a title shot, but their opponent is anybody's guess.

&amp;#x200B;

WELTERWEIGHT

(C) Kamaru Usman vs #4 Jorge Masvidal                              VS       #1 Colby Covington

\#2 Gilbert Burns vs #3 Edwards/#13 Muhammad          VS   #5 Stephen Thompson vs #6 Michael Chiesa

I had already mapped out a plan for 170, but as I began writing this post I got the news about Belal Muhammad filling in to fight Leon Edwards. Now, the next opponent for Gilbert Burns may be a bit more clear. Burns has been itching for another fight after his title fight loss to Kamaru Usman just under a week ago. Maybe he could fight the winner of Edwards-Muhammad. Either one is a great counter part to either the striking or grappling of Burns. As for Thompson-Chiesa, I personally love this matchup. The classic argument of Striker vs Grappler. Thompson of course was an undefeated kickboxer before stepping into MMA, and Michael Chiesa has a gnarly submission game with 11 subs in 18 victories. With the real chance that Kamaru Usman, and Jorge Masvidal will be coaching the 29th season of The Ultimate Fighter, it would be obvious for those two to fight each other next. However, if there's one thing for certain in my mind, it's that Colby Covington is going to fight for the title in his next bout. Whether it's his sequel with Kamaru Usman, or his long awaited, and highly intense grudge match with Masvidal, there will be blood, and there will be GOLD.

&amp;#x200B;

MIDDLEWEIGHT (also a murky one)

SCENARIO #1 - IF Israel Adesanya wins the LHW title

\#1 Robert Whittaker vs #2 Paulo Costa                       VS           #4 Darren Till vs #5 Marvin Vettori

\#3 Jared Cannonier vs ???                                               VS           #7 Derek Brunson vs #10 Kevin Holland

SCENARIO #2 - IF Israel Adesanya loses the LHW title

\#1 Robert Whittaker vs #2 Paulo Costa                       VS           (C) Israel Adesanya

\#4 Darren Till vs #5 Marvin Vettori                               VS           #7 Derek Brunson vs #10 Kevin Holland

Quick disclaimer, in scenario 1, the winner of Whittaker-Costa fights the winner of Till-Vettori for the title. Just wanted to clear that up. Jared Cannonier's next bout will most likely be against either Kelvin Gastelum, Uriah Hall, or Chris Weidman, or he like Cory Sandhagen, and Colby Covington, could have a bye in the first round of the hypothetical Grand Prix, and face the winner of Brunson-Holland. However, if Adesanya loses to Blachowicz, then Cannonier will likely fight the winner of Uriah Hall-Chris Weidman later this year. I must say that we will have a very interesting scenario if Till or Vettori fights against either Brunson or Holland, as that would make for a pretty entertaining show.

&amp;#x200B;

LIGHT HEAVYWEIGHT

(C) Jan Blachowicz vs (C-MW) Israel Adesanya             VS              #1 Glover Teixeira

\#2 Thiago Santos vs #4 Aleksander Rakic                    VS              #3 Dominick Reyes vs #5 Jiri Prochazka

Let me get this out of the way, Israel Adesanya is my favorite fighter. This fight is super intense for me and other weebs around the world, as Adesanya looks to be the first double champ since Henry Cejudo beat Marlon Moraes in 2019 to capture bantamweight gold. My heart will be rushing, and my mind will be in a frenzy come March 6th (barring COVID cancellations of course). But enough about me, I have to explain this. If you had any wet dreams of Israel Adesanya and Jon Jones fighting each other, then you're probably going to have to wait a little bit longer. The reason being, is because the winner of the 205 title at UFC 259 will face Glover Teixeira for the title next, while Jones is fully dedicated to bulking up for heavyweight. Who knows if the rest of the Grand Prix will even matter in time for Adesanya and Jones to finally settle their beef. Will those two fight at heavyweight, will Adesanya fight with the big boys permanently if he gets past Blachowicz and Teixeira. The world may never when, where, or what weight Adesanya and Jones will fight, but man oh man, does the bottom half of that LHW Grand Prix look electric. Santos-Rakic, and Reyes-Prochazka will be classics, and the winner of those two bouts against each other will make for a dogfight.

&amp;#x200B;

HEAVYWEIGHT

(C) Stipe Miocic vs #1 Francis Ngannou                        VS              Jon Jones

\#2 Curtis Blaydes vs #4 Derrick Lewis                           VS            #3 Jairzinho Rozenstruik vs #7 Ciryl Gane

And finally, here we are, the last division on the list. When I first started thinking about Grand Prix concepts, this division came up first. This weekend, Curtis Blaydes will hopefully fight Derrick Lewis, then next week, Rozenstruik will fight Gane in the main event of that fight night. The winner of these two bouts should face each other, because, frankly, it would do any one of them a disservice to sit and wait for Miocic or Ngannou to fight Jones. Plus, it would really make the next contender in line very clear. Expect the winners of Blaydes-Lewis, and Rozenstruik-Gane to headline an event in May or June, maybe even July this year. As for Miocic-Ngannou II, expect the winner to face Jon Jones in July or August most likely.

\- Defense is 50% of striking/boxing. I'm kinda sick of people saying ""he's got great \_\_\_\_\_"" when their defense is shit. Bisping's a good example. He got better at setups and combos, but his defense was legit awful til the day he retired.",MMA related hills you're willing to die on?,2591,1

Some takeaways: 
- Clay Guida debuted in strikeforce, then WEC, then the UFC all in 2006, winning all three debuts. The only other two fighters to appear in three lists are Nate Diaz and Robbie Lawler. 
- I didn't realize Tim Boetsch was still in the UFC, hasn't fought in almost two years.
- Stefan Struve would have appeared on the list had he not just retired.
- If Nick Diaz comes back to fight in the UFC he would be the only on to appear on all four lists.
- Arlovski is the only one to have debuted  in the UFC over twenty years ago.
- Roxanne is the only female to appear in any of the lists.
- the majority of fighters have either held or fought for a UFC title. 

What do you guys think? Who will be the last one to retire/leave the ufc? How many of them still have a shot at a title? Anyone surprise you that they've been in that long?",Current UFC fighters that debuted before 2010,47,1

For all I know, I could be very wrong and I’d love to hear what everybody has to say. Maybe this is heretical to the pre-Zuffa, dark age purists, but should the UFC replace the cage? To me, like the UFC official gloves, the Octagon as it stands has a lot of flaws that can be exploited. For example, the fence to me is the worst offender, because it opens up situations where fighters can interlock fingers or toes to defend grappling, notoriously (pun intended) seen when Conor fought Khabib and more recently when Augusto Sakai blatantly grabbed the fence to stop a crucial late takedown from Blagoy Ivanov. In both cases, well-regarded referees (Herb Dean and Jason Herzog) didn’t appropriately punish the fouls that were committed. Furthermore, although rare, the cage links are sharp or abrasive, and capable of cutting open fighters, as seen in Matt Brown vs Carlos Condit, where Brown’s face was sliced open trying to get Condit down in Round 1. Condit would go on to win the round off his back due to his striking, and I have to wonder if it was because the judges thought Condit sliced Brown open off his back. That brings me to my final point, which is that judges seem like they get a pretty bad view of the fight through the cage. Not only are their faces pretty low, but it also seems like the cage obstructs their view of the fight, especially in important, small details like if strikes are being blocked or landing flush on the ground. The main problem I’d have with replacing the Octagon is that I don’t know of a sufficient solution. I don’t think a hockey-style plexi-glass cage would work because of how fighters hitting their heads on the cage could be damaging, so I don’t really know the alternative.",Is the cage/Octagon a bad design?

Look at Yan for example. It is my opinion that Jones was not becoming diminished. It was that the competition eventually catches up to the bar that was set. So Yan has lost to Santos (Feb 2019). Santos looses a very close fight to Jones. The skill gap was close. Yan beats Reyes. Reyes lost a very close fight to Jones. The skill gap is close still. Yan KO’s Reyes C.Anderson Rockhold (Who imo was a lot healthier at LHW) and has a close one with Jacare.

It comes to me that these top 5 fighters can beat each other on any given night. Including beating Jones if he stuck around a little longer. So my thought was just how many Jon Jones’esk fighters are there in this devision. 

Probably a lot more than we give credit to. Sure Yan has lost to people like Cummings in the past but with some ‘looking into it’ Yan also beat C.Anderson who beat Cummings.

All is that I am saying. Some fans are sleeping on Yan a lot more than they should into the Issy fight.

For my next example. DJ. The pound for pound GOAT imo. He beat everyone. It took 6 years. 11 title defence. For a close decision to go the other way. And look at who did. Cejudo. His recent record was a win over DJ. A finish over EPO TJ. Goes up an finishes Moraes. Then finishes Cruz.

Now I know what you’re thinking. Holy shit that is fucking illegal.

The LHW devision is a bracket where the competition has been so thoroughly distilled. I reckon that Issy even with stylistic advantages. Is in waters much deeper than people realise.

He dug so deep in his fight with Geoff Neal, to have a battered face and torn quad going into the last round and still dominating. He's 38 and still taking out future contenders. 


Fans will cite his losses (all but one were very close decisions) and for some reason they're ready for Colby (who got brutalized in the later rounds before being finished by the Usman) to get a *second* title shot after a single win over a completely checked out Tyron Woodley. 


You have more fans vouching for Masvidal, of all people, to get a title shot over Wonderboy. That should say something about the state of the division. When Masvidal, who has a worse record than Wonderboy, who got absolutely dominated from pillar to post against the champ has a better chance at fighting for the belt than Wonderboy it's crazy. 


Wonderboy has beaten tough competition. He took a prime champion Woodley to a (Majority) draw. He KO'd Robert Whittaker in the first round. He made Masvidal look like he didn't belong. In his last two fights he's ended Neal's 7 fight win streak and Vicente Luque's 6 fight win streak. Luque has went on to pick up two more wins after his loss to Thompson. 

How is Wonderboy, someone that has fought in the UFC for 9 years now, still beating future contenders/up and comers, *and* is 38 years old at the end of his career not deserving of a title shot? What is he supposed to prove? What the hell does that even mean for him at this point? You want him to show you some sort of arbitrary landmark of improvement? At 38? No. This is the age where people in this sport start declining and taking a ton of damage. He's as good as we will ever see him and each fight he takes from this point forward will only see him slow down. With his injuries and time between fights, his next few fights could legitimately be the last few good performances we see from him.


I read on here ""Wonderboy should get one more win first"". Yet we're just fine with Masvidal and Covington getting another shot. Fans throw around the words ""Earned"" and ""Deserved"" and in reality those words don't mean anything to the promotion. They gave Jose Aldo a title shot after a decision loss to Marlon. Masvidal got a title shot after a win over Ben Askren and Nate Diaz. Askren who was unproven in the UFC and Nate Diaz who is damn near a .500 fighter.  Don't even get me started on the amount of title shots that Urijah Faber has gotten.


You all know damn well they would've given Khamzat Chimaev a title shot if he had beat Leon Edwards. 


What's going to further put salt in the wounds is that we may end up seeing yet another case of a fighter that could have tested a champ simply being too old or having too many injuries by the time we see them in the cage. Or worse, they may make him take another fight or two and we may just see him decline heavily. Athlete declines are sharp and come out of seemingly nowhere and it's depressing to watch. 


A popular recent example is watching a 37 year old Tony Ferguson decline after we all saw how much of a monster he was. No one can lie to us about how good he was. He was the boogeyman. Wonderboy is 38, he's already past his prime, and guess what? If he doesn't get a title shot ASAP that's what we're going to see again. Another fighter that could've been a great match up for the champ simply declining instead of getting a shot at him.  


Wonderboy is getting injured now. He breaks his hands in every fight, he tore his quad in his last fight too, he has torn every ligament in his knees. He's starting to get hit more.  What more do you want him to prove? Do you know just how risky every fight at this point of his career is for him? 


He has nothing left to prove and you all should be outraged that the UFC would pass him up for Masvidal or Colby.","Wonderboy has nothing left to prove to be a contender in the eyes of the fans and at 38, if he doesn't get a title shot ASAP, we'll only be watching his decline and wonder what could've been.",341,1

I just wanna ask what are some of your thoughts on Almeida.

Some key points 

\- Was once 21-0, he has lost 4 out of his last 5 fights since 2016. Outside of his last loss to Jonathan Martinez (who is a hot prospect in the division), he has has lost to some of the top competition in the division.

* Then undefeated and surging Cody who practically ran through the division in 2016.
* A then 20-1 Jimmie Rivera who has only lost to the absolute best of the division
* Rob Font (who has been in the UFC since 2014 but finally catapulted to the top of the division in the last 2 years)
* Lastly, Jonathan Martinez, young prospect who with a few more wins could be a name at the top of the division.

Notice  that even with his recent losses, the UFC is still pairing him with top prospects or bonified contenders.

Even with the recent losses, he still has 17 wins by knockout/tko, and 4 by submission.

The man is a finisher.

Sean O'Malley was the hottest prospect in the UFC since McGregor and the UFC were putting their whole marketing machine behind O'Malley which in return is/was a good idea as he is infact very marketable. 

O'Malley coming off his first professional loss in which we all know he got his leg turned off by the very game Marlon Vera, personally amongst the ground and pound I think O'Malley actually got put unconscious for a split second.

Almeida has A LOT riding on this fight, I see it more likely than not he gets released if he loses. O'Malley's hype train could be redeemed with an impressive finish over Almeida, but also I think if O'Malley loses his hype is indefinitely gone.

What are your predictions for the fight? 

 I think if O'Malley keeps it at a distance, stays on the feet and keeps Almeida in the mid-range, it will look similar to Eddie Wineland fight, early KO for O'Malley.

BUT

If Almeida is able to find his rhythm early, land a few kicks and keep O'Malley on the backfoot, and make it a technical brawl, I think Almeida can come up with a +250 underdog win. Almeida loves to mix his knees with overhands, O'Malley is fairly lanky due to his height, I would imagine Almeida can handle O'Malley in the clinch or on the ground.

If Almeida has to either be all the way in, or all the way out and I think he can win the fight fairly easily.

Welcome back all! This week, I am going to be doing breakdowns for the Co-Main and Main event. Also as a planning note, I am also currently working on a ton of breakdowns for UFC 259.

To create the following analysis, I watched every fight of the two fighters that I pulled data from and mixed my own visual analysis with statistical breakdowns I created for the two fighters. Statistical analytics were drawn from my Judging Model as well as my new [Fighter Accumulated Strategy and Tactics (FAST) models](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/lj3ppm/how_i_am_using_unsupervised_machine_learning_to/). I will be breaking down each fighter's past high level strategy and specific fight tactics and then investigate their ratings based upon their round win % as determined by the Judging Model.

**Visual Scouting:**

First up, Yana Kunitskaya. Yana profiles as a highly technical, distance based striker. Her taekwondo background is evident and she possesses a really strong high guard. She takes a balanced approach to MMA striking, mixing punches, kicks, knees and elbows effectively. Overall, I analyzed her as a point fighter that tries to minimize damage taken while out pointing her opponents.

Yana utilizes her clinch skills as a way of nullifying opponents who enter her range. Yana sort of has two gears: fighting at distance, picking away at her opponents with teep kicks and punches or rushing her opponents and clinching up against the cage to throw muay thai knees. Yana has shown a suspect chin in the past, she is for sure beatable when facing power punches

Ketlen Vieira on the other hand profiles as a powerful pocket fighter. She is trying to bridge the distance and land with power shots. Both fighters showed slick judo skills which I am a huge fan of. Vieira’s strength and size advantage for the weight class (Vieira is 5’8” tall) will make it tough for Yana to clinch her up and land power knees. I believe that Ketlen will have the advantage in these exchanges which takes away one of Yana’s main two weapons.

Ketlen showed a pretty strong chin against bomb thrower Irene Aldana getting caught a couple times before succumbing to her power. Yana doesn’t show much power and Ketlen has a strong chin so I doubt Ketlen gets KO’d in this matchup. One of the big problems I see in Ketlen’s game going forward is she hangs her chin and wings hooks the way that Cody Garbrandt does. Higher level strikers like Aldana, Holly Holm, and of course Amanda Nunes will catch her and put her away unless she adjusts her defensive skills.

**Data Analysis:**

&amp;#x200B;

|**Offensive Strategic Class** | **Number of Rounds** | **Win %** | **% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Grappling Heavy |6|67%|50%|
| Balanced Grappler |4|100%|33.3%|
| Striking Heavy |2|100%|16.7%|

 Yana’s skills as a clinch fighter show up right off the bat. She is a highly efficient fighter in this regard and her strength advantage over most fighters shows up in her efficiency scores.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class** | **Number of Rounds** | **Win %** | **% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
| Striking Heavy |6|100%|50%|
|Balanced Striker|3|67%|25%|
|Balanced Grappler |2|100%|16.7%|
|Grappling Heavy |1|0%|8.3%|

 Yana’s winning ways continue when looking at her opponent classes. She is most effective when fighting against striking heavy fighters but also proves to be effective against balanced fighting styles as well.  


|**Offensive Strategic Class** | **Number of Rounds** | **Win %** | **% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy |3|33%|42.9%|
|Balanced Striker|2|100%|28.6%|
|Grappling Heavy |2|50%|28.6%|

 Ketlen on the other hand does not show as a very efficient fighter when going striking heavy but is more effective when she adds in her grappling skills to over power her opponents. When compared to Yana, Yana would likely win a points fight against Ketlen if she is not able to bridge the distance and land with power or clinch up with Yana.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class** |**Number of Rounds** | **Win %** | **% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy |6|67%|85.7%|
|Balanced Striker|1|0%|14.3%|

 Overwhelmingly, fighters choose to stand and trade with Ketlen. She wins these at a clip of 2 out of 3. Solid defensive efficiency for Ketlen.

|Striking Heavy |Tree Chopper|1|100%|8.3%|

 Breaking it down further, Yana fights predominantly in what I am calling the Anaconda class. This is a fighter who utilizes grappling as a means of tiring out their opponents with takedowns and strong control positions. Yana wins these at a 60% rate which is low based on my research. Her second highest class is clinch which she wins at a 100% rate.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class** |**Defensive Tactical Class** |**Number of Rounds** | **Win %** | **% of Total Rounds** |

|Balanced Grappler |High output|2|100%|16.7%|
|Striking Heavy |Balanced|2|100%|16.7%|
|Grappling Heavy |Head Hunter|1|0%|8.3%|

 Most of Yana’s opponents choose to fight her with lots of volume mainly focused on her head. I have noticed this as a common way to combat strong distance fighters like Yana so I don’t find it all that surprising.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Offensive Strategic Class** |**Offensive Tactical Class** |**Number of Rounds** | **Win %** | **% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy |Head Hunter|3|33%|42.9%|

|Grappling Heavy |Ground and Pound|1|100%|14.3%|
|Grappling Heavy |Head Hunter|1|0%|14.3%|

 Ketlen fights predominantly how most opponents choose to fight Yana. High output, head hunting. She is surprisingly ineffective as a striking heavy head hunter. She will have to mix in her clinch work to close the distance on Yana and steal rounds from her.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class** |**Defensive Tactical Class** |**Number of Rounds** | **Win %** | **% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy |Balanced|3|67%|42.9%|
|Striking Heavy |Head Hunter|3|67%|42.9%|
|Balanced Striker|High Output Head Hunter|1|0%|14.3%|

 Fighters choose to strike heavy with Ketlen and either take a balanced approach or head hunt. Ketlen profiles as an average striking defender in this regard.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

Based on the mix of scouting and data analysis, I expect Yana to try and fight Ketlen at range whereas Ketlen is going to bull rush to cover distance and throw haymakers/clinch up. Ketlen has more ways to win because of her power advantage on Yana. Ketlen will never be out of this fight because she always has the opportunity to pull an Aspen Ladd on Yana and knock her out with a bull rush. Yana’s strategy is a points victory where she keeps Ketlen at distance and chips away at her defenses. One thing to note, this fight is in the smaller cage in the UFC PI which is going to have a large effect on Yana’s ability to stay at distance. Ketlen’s path to victory is clinching up with Yana and throwing power knees and elbows to win a points victory or bridging the distance between the two of them and landing a power shot that puts Yana down with a KO/TKO. I project that Ketlen bridges the distance and wins on points or by knockout.","Yana vs. Ketlen, a Data Science and Analytics Breakdown",13,1

\- Early KO (less likely)

\- Scramble ends up with Lewis in top control for a long period (over 1 minute) of round 1 or two. Blaydes takes damage and becomes depleted. Lewis wins by decision.

\- Lewis wins by GNP in round 1 or 2

Obviously Blaydes has one scenario for victory, get Lewis on his back for long periods of the fight. This is possible, but I think its more of a 50/50 situation.

This week, I am going to be doing breakdowns for the Co-Main and Main event. Also as a planning note, I am also currently working on a ton of breakdowns for UFC 259.

To create the following analysis, I watched every fight of the two fighters that I pulled data from and mixed my own visual analysis with statistical breakdowns I created for the two fighters. Statistical analytics were drawn from my Judging Model as well as my new [Fighter Accumulated Strategy and Tactics (FAST) models](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/lj3ppm/how_i_am_using_unsupervised_machine_learning_to/). I will be breaking down each fighter's past high level strategy and specific fight tactics and then investigate their ratings based upon their round win % as determined by the Judging Model.

 

**Visual Scouting:**

First, let’s start off with Lewis. Lewis’ power jumps off the screen. Watching the speed and power with which he throws his “frozen turkeys”, as Paul Felder called them on the broadcast, was spectacular. I was also surprised to see the power and speed with which he throws his kicks. My mental image of Derrick Lewis is an upright bomb thrower that practices just-get-up-jitsu. Lewis’ combinations also look crisp and powerful. Watching him throw against Junior Dos Santos was a spectacle to behold.

Lewis is a prototypical power, counter puncher. This leads him to oftentimes utilizing techniques like his flying knee and naked leg kicks to initiate contact with his opponent. I agree with his coaches who say that he needs to initiate more on offense and get his opponents on their back foots where his power can be dominant. The other aspect of Lewis’ game that I would like to see him build out is a power leg kicking game. Lewis has legit power in his kicks and if he can limit his opponents mobility, his powerful, accurate power shots can land with greater effect. The addition of a slick leg kicking game would really complement his skill set and help him against more skilled MMA fighters like Stipe and (previously) Cormier.

On to Curtis Blaydes. Curtis has a really unique skill set for the heavyweight division. I don’t want to jump the shark too much on my analytics section but Curtis profiles as what I have been calling an Anaconda Tactician. High takedowns and a low takedown to control time ratio. Curtis doesn’t want you to just get taken down, he wants you to get up so he can do it again and sap you of your hope and energy.

Curtis’ biggest problem in my opinion is in his ability to finish fighters, specifically, his Brazilian Jiu Jitsu skills. Curtis could be a PROBLEM at heavyweight if he developed his submission skills and merged them with his truly dominant “Anaconda” skills. Personally, I really wish I could see Curtis against a younger Fabricio Werdum or a fighter of that skill profile. This would allow me to really see if Curtis can adapt to a fighter whose strengths lineup with what Curtis wants to do.

In my notes I mentioned multiple times that Curtis does not take advantage of the poor BJJ positioning of his opponents. Instead, he chooses to hold his control position and throw the occasional strike. I see this as a hole in Curtis’ game. Fighters like Lewis could get dominated for 24.5 minutes of a fight only to throw one power bomb that knocks Curtis’ lights out and ends his title run. That to me is a problem that Curtis needs to address. To further this statistically, Curtis has never attempted a submission attempt in his UFC career. For a ground dominant fighter this is a pretty major hole. In my research, I found that Curtis is a blue belt in BJJ which makes sense to me based on what I have seen. On to statistics!

 

**Data Analysis:**

For each fighter, I have taken their fights from November 2018 onward. This encompasses Lewis’ shot at the title and Blaydes last loss vs Ngannou in their second matchup. First up: Lewis.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Offensive Strategic Class** |**Number of Rounds** |**Win %** |**% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|6|0%|66.7%|
|Balanced Grappler|1|100%|11.1%|
|Balanced Striker|1|100%|11.1%|
|Grappling Heavy|1|100%|11.1%|

 A little context that I think explains the above numbers. My model is trained on previous 30-27 or 50-45 decisions. Power counter punchers like Lewis don’t really get that far in fights. They usually knock their opponents out pretty early or get dominated and lose. My model sees Lewis as a low output power puncher and so if he doesn’t grapple (ground and pound/clinch) he loses the round in my model’s eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class** |**Number of Rounds** |**Win %** |**% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Balanced Striker|3|33%|33.3%|
|Grappling Heavy|3|33%|33.3%|
|Balanced Grappler|2|50%|22.2%|
|Striking Heavy|1|0%|11.1%|

 Same concept applies here, he profiles as a low efficiency power puncher who gets beaten on the score cards but can knock guys out like Volkov two years ago. Up next, Blaydes.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Offensive Strategic Class** |**Number of Rounds** |**Win %** |**% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Grappling Heavy|7|86%|77.8% |
|Balanced Grappler|1|100%|11.1%|
|Striking Heavy|1|100%|11.1%|

 Unsurprisingly, Blaydes profiles as a ground specialist who wins at a high rate. I am going to go out on a limb here and say he is for sure going to try to enact this strategy on Lewis.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class** |**Number of Rounds** |**Win %** |**% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|8|100%|88.9%|
|Balanced Striker|1|0%|11.1%|

 Basically, if you try to stand with Blaydes you are going to get decimated. But if you mix in some grappling you have a chance. I think this is more a function of how dominant Blaydes is on the ground though. To me, the best way to beat Blaydes is a guard player or a Stipe type with strong takedown defense and superior striking. Next up, Lewis' tactics.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Offensive Strategic Class** |**Offensive Tactical Class** |**Number of Rounds** |**Win %** |**% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|Head Hunter|3|0%|33.3%|
|Striking Heavy|Balanced|2|0%|22.2%|
|Balanced Grappler|Clinch|1|100%|11.1%|
|Balanced Striker|Clinch|1|100%|11.1%|
|Grappling Heavy|Ground and Pound|1|100%|11.1%|
|Striking Heavy|Tree Chopper|1|0%|11.1%|

 Lewis profiles as a mix of head hunting and balanced striking. I believe the balanced rounds come from rounds where he throws in some leg kicks and flying knees. Tactical rounds are based on ratios so if Lewis throws five strikes in a round and one is a flying knee then he will look “balanced” in the model’s eyes.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class** |**Defensive Tactical Class** |**Number of Rounds** |**Win %** |**% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Balanced Grappler|Anaconda|2|50%|22.2%|
|Balanced Striker|Clinch|2|50%|22.2%|
|Balanced Striker|High Output Head Hunter|1|0%|11.1%|
|Grappling Heavy|Anaconda|1|0%|11.1%|
|Grappling Heavy|Ground and Pound|1|0%|11.1%|
|Grappling Heavy|Head Hunter|1|100%|11.1%|
|Striking Heavy|Balanced|1|0%|11.1%|

 Fighters take a varied approach to fighting Lewis, most with success. Lewis’ power is the great equalizer though and he can turn the table in a fight with seconds left. What I see is 3 instances total of Anaconda which is a class that requires lots of control time as well as multiple takedowns. Lewis' just-get-up-jitsu creates a lot of opportunities for fighters to capitalize on from this vantage point.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Offensive Strategic Class** |**Offensive Tactical Class** |**Number of Rounds** |**Win %** |**% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Grappling Heavy|Head Hunter|4|75%|44.4%|
|Grappling Heavy|Anaconda|3|100%|33.3%|
|Balanced Grappler|Anaconda|1|100%|11.1%|
|Striking Heavy|Head Hunter|1|100%|11.1%|

 Blaydes fights as the quintessential Anaconda tactical role. High takedown, strong control in clinch and the ground. You know what Blaydes is going to do but the question is, can you stop it? The answer is probably no in Lewis' case. This one may look just like Volkov with him getting rag dolled all over the cage for 25 minutes.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Defensive Strategic Class** |**Defensive Tactical Class** |**Number of Rounds** |**Win %** |**% of Total Rounds** |
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Striking Heavy|Head Hunter|4|100%|44.4%|
|Striking Heavy|Balanced|2|100%|22.2%|
|Striking Heavy|Tree Chopper|2|100%|22.2%|
|Balanced Striker|High Output Head Hunter|1|0%|11.1%|

Not much to see here because of how dominant Blaydes has been. Basically, volume striking has been the only way he was beaten in my model's eyes.

 

**Conclusion:**

Blaydes has many more ways to win than Lewis does. Blaydes clinch and ground skills will be overwhelming to Lewis. However, Blaydes inability to finish could very well lead to a late round KO victory for Lewis though. Lewis needs to land with power to beat Blaydes whereas Blaydes needs to Anaconda Lewis into gassing out so that he can’t land with his trademark power. I believe that Blaydes takes this one by points.

Working on this and seeing the way my model rated Lewis gave me a great idea for how to expand these articles out with new algorithms. I am hoping to have it ready for the next two weeks of breakdowns. It will add further depth to the analytics and really take things a step further","Derrick Lewis vs Curtis Blaydes, a Data Science and Analytics Breakdown",46,1

9,loh7re,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/loh7re/any_resources_on_greco_roman_throws/,No-Emergency-6032,2021-02-20 21:30:32,MMA,"Hi,

I'm currently looking into the concept of throws which you can apply frontally and from the standup position. I prefer throws that don't require going to the lower lever and putting your knees on the ground (like single leg or double leg), but go from the standup/ upper level. Also important that they leave you standing or go over to a controlling position (and not land in the opponents guillotine or guard or roll over to their side control)

Currently I'm looking into judo throws (not a judoka) and I found these pretty interesting:

* [Kosoto Gake](https://judoinfo.com/kosotogake/)
* [Ouchi Gari](https://judoinfo.com/ouchigari/)
* [kouchi gari](https://judoinfo.com/kouchigari/)
* [hiza guruma](https://judoinfo.com/hizaguruma/)
* [osoto gari](https://judoinfo.com/osotogari/)

(basically where you apply frontally and make the opponent trip).

But a lot of ""no gi upper body throws"" are still missing. And I find the greco roman no gi grips super interesting. In greco roman I found the

* arm drags/pull bys interesting, because you get the back afterwards and bodylock.
* But also the bodylocks throws and
* hip lifts/throws are interesting (not those where you turn your back or do a suplex, but where you put the opponent to the side, having more control).

So I'm kind of looking for resources about it, but I have trouble in finding good ones. Do you know some resources to look into and would you recommend greco roman for modern/mixed martial arts?

Thx in advance!

EDIT: Why the downvote, am I breaking some rules with this question, isn't this reddit supposed for questions? If it's just disagreeing then please leave a comment too.","Any resources on ""greco roman"" throws?",7,2

I decided to look at them more closely and I think it's obvious that the guys from the last season aren't really good. Here's their records:

Dustin Jacoby 1-0

Jordan Leavitt 1-0

Dustin Stoltzfus 0-1

Adrian Yanez 1-0

Cory McKenna 1-0

TJ Laramie 0-1

Impa Kasanganay 1-1

Louis Cosce 0-1

Josh Parisian 0-1

Jamie Pickett 0-1

Jimmy Flick 1-0

William Knight 1-0

Tafon Nchukwi 1-0

Phil Hawes 1-0

Drako Rodriguez 0-1

Jordan Williams 0-1

Jared Vanderaa 0-1

Victoria Leonardo 0-1

One of these 18 fought twice (Kasanganay, one win and one loss). Out of other 17, more than a half (9) started in UFC with a loss. And it's not like they were thrown to the wolves, like Bevon Lewis against Uriah Hall. So far half of these guys failed against fighters from the lowest tiers of their divisions. 

And this problem actually started from the season 3. Here's the UFC records of 30 fighters who were awarded a contract in 2019:

Punahele Soriano 2-0

Hannah Goldy 0-1

Yorgan De Castro 1-2

Miles Jones 2-1

Miguel Baeza 3-0

Joe Solecki 2-0

Hunter Azure 2-1

Maki Pitolo 1-4

Jonathan Pearce 1-1

Antonio Arroyo 0-2

Ode Osbourne 1-1

Don'Tale Mayes 1-2

Brendan Allen 3-1

Sean Woodson 1-1

Jamahal Hill 2-0 (1 NC)

Billy Quarantillo 3-1

Aleksa Camur 1-1

Aalon Cruz 0-1

Tracy Cortez 2-0

Rodrigo Nascimento 1-1

Omar Moralez 2-1

Herbert Burns 2-1

Andre Muniz 2-0

Brok Weaver 1-2

Sarah Alpar 0-1

Tony Gravely 1-1

Philip Rowe 0-1

Dusko Todorovic 1-1

Peter Barrett 0-2

TJ Brown 0-2

Out of these 30 only 12 (!) have positive UFC record and only 6 are still undefeated in octagon. BTW, the most successful of them, Miguel Baeza, won his DWCS fight not by flashy KO but by decision, and probably got the contract only because his opponent was overweight. And that's the problem - Contender Series so far doesn't create stars, it creates Fight Night prelim fodder. But you don't need an entire show for that.",DWCS alumni are kinda suck lately,75,23

This past event was a huge night for the heavyweight division, seeing two new ranked contenders emerge, and a huge upset by none other than the Black Beast, Derrick Lewis. Here's the fights that need to be made after an explosive night of MMA.

Before I get into the fights, here are my new, updated rankings for tonights most prominent division, the heavyweights:

(C) Stipe Miocic

\#1 Francis Ngannou

\#2 Derrick Lewis

\#3 Jairzinho Rozenstruik

\#4 Curtis Blaydes

\#5 Alexander Volkov

\#6 Alistair Overeem

\#7 Ciryl Gane

\#8 Shamil Abdurakhimov

\#9 Augusto Sakai

\#10 Walt Harris

\#11 Chris Daukaus

\#12 Tom Aspinall

\#13 Junior Dos Santos

\#14 Aleksei Oleinik

\#15 Marcin Tybura

&amp;#x200B;

MATCHUP #1 - Tom Aspinall &amp; Chris Daukaus need to fight each other next.

RESULTS OF THEIR FIGHTS: Aspinall defeats Arlovski via 2nd round submission (rear-naked choke), Daukaus defeats Oleinik via 1st round TKO (punches).

The two newly ranked HW contenders that emerged after tonights KO-filled card, were of course, Liverpool's bright, and entertaining talent in Tom Aspinall, and Philadelphia native, Chris Daukaus. Both Aspinall, and Daukaus showed impressive striking in their pursuit of victory, and while Aspinall did adapt to grappling, his shoot-in on the takedown was pretty impressive. Daukaus was able to defend himself from Oleinik's grappling, both standing, and preventing any takedowns, and an onslaught Daukaus was able to close the fight in under one round, which notably Derrick Lewis wasn't able to do. However, there are the issues with the overall striking of both fighters. I found that Aspinall showed the tendency to strike out of his range, especially when going for combinations, while Daukaus could've worked the body a little bit more against Oleinik. Nevertheless, these were two outstanding performances, and I think that a matchup between Aspinall and Daukaus is one that can help iron out the wrinkles that these two have, and potentially reveal a legitimate threat in the division.

&amp;#x200B;

MATCHUP #2 - Phil Hawes should fight Brendan Allen after his MD victory over Nassourdine Imavov.

Now 2-0 into his UFC career, Phil Hawes surprisingly didn't put France's Nassourdine Imavov away in one round. Instead the fight became a well contested bout on the feet, with Hawes using his often forgot about wrestling chops to control the fight and escape with a majority decision win. Hawes came extremely close to being finished, getting wobbled multiple times in the third round, before halting the offense of Imavov by using the clinch to hang on. Hawes' wrestling, which comes from a D1 background at Iowa State, was impressive, and the overall body strength by Hawes is outstanding for the 185 lb division. Give Hawes a test against fellow Contender Series prospect, Brendan Allen, an outstanding grappler who while unfortunately losing to Sean Strickland in November, still has wins over fighters like Kyle Daukaus, Tom Breese, and most notably Kevin Holland. Both Hawes, and Allen have outstanding finish rates, and perhaps their grappling could cancel out, and present to us MMA fans a slugfest.

&amp;#x200B;

MATCHUP #3 - Yana Kunitskaya upsets Ketlen Vieira, and with that, earns another shot at the top 5.

I predicted that Yana Kunitskaya's grappling work would help her pull off the upset over the strongly favored Ketlen Vieira, and sure enough it did. Kunitskaya is 2-0, with two dominant victories since losing to Aspen Ladd in 2019. With Germaine de Randemie recently finishing Julianna Pena, who is now booked against Holly Holm, the matchup for Yana that makes the most sense is Irene Aldana. Both fighters have wins over Ketlen Vieira, and both are extremely fierce contenders, and despite suffering a setback against Holly Holm, Aldana is still as dangerous as they come.

&amp;#x200B;

MATCHUP #4 - Despite his impressive victory, Derrick Lewis won't be fighting for the title in his next bout.

Derrick Lewis once again defied the odds, and finished Curtis Blaydes, who was the -450 favorite entering tonight's main event. Lewis' 2nd round finish will go down as one of the most stunning wins, and biggest upsets of 2021. However, even with a win like this, I still had the path for the winner of tonight's main event set. In a recent reddit post, I made a hypothetical Grand Prix for the UFC, and if you look at it, you can see who should face who. It's simple: Lewis won't fight the winner of Miocic-Ngannou, because Jon Jones is moving up to attempt to become a two division champion. If Lewis were to wait for a title shot, he would likely be getting it around this time in 2022, which of course is an unfair advantage for him, as seen by the negative effects of a year long layoff. The most ideal opponent for Lewis is the winner of Rozenstruik-Gane, which is being held next weekend. That will decide who will face either Miocic, Ngannou, or Jones for the title. The only way I could see Lewis fighting for the title next, is if either UFC 260 headliner suffered an injury or tested positive for COVID-19, thus creating a potential opening for Derrick Lewis. All in all, it is still looking to be a huge, and unforgettable year for the heavyweight division.

I've been seeing more and more about the legendary ability of 'polish power' and that Jan Blachowiz has bloomed late into a one punch knockout artist, that is a dangerous threat to Adesanya.

This to me doesn't make much sense. Jan Blachowiz has 8 KOs out of 27 wins. He has more submission wins (at 9) and the hype around his power seems to be very recent. I don't consider a very big LHW that can knockout an average fighter like Corey Anderson to be particularly impressive. Nor do I consider his knockout of a overconfident chinny middleweight rockhold who abandoned his striking defense a high acheivement either.

His highest level KO was against Reyes, who had a good showing against Jones. But I still don't see a K.O. artist in Jan, I saw a big volume striker with appropriate power for his size, pile damage on to a good but inexperienced striker who was trying to walk him down. It was a good win, but not a particularly special KO when you consider how they were both fighting.

I'm not saying Israel has an easy fight, this is still a huge fighter at a weight class he hasn't been at (in MMA), there is still the grappling factor. But Jan is not going to present a whole lot of danger in the striking department that Izzy hasn't faced before.",Jan Blachowiz is not a K.O. artist.,52,1

The 6th UFC event of 2021 is in the books, seeing yet another ranked heavyweight bout go down, with one more being held next week. This past event was a huge night for the heavyweight division, seeing two new ranked contenders emerge, and a huge upset by none other than the Black Beast, Derrick Lewis. Here's the fights that need to be made after an explosive night of MMA.

Before I get into the fights, here are my new, updated rankings for tonights most prominent division, the heavyweights:

(C) Stipe Miocic

\#1 Francis Ngannou

\#2 Derrick Lewis

\#3 Jairzinho Rozenstruik

\#4 Curtis Blaydes

\#5 Alexander Volkov

\#6 Alistair Overeem

\#7 Ciryl Gane

\#8 Shamil Abdurakhimov

\#9 Augusto Sakai

\#10 Walt Harris

\#11 Chris Daukaus

\#12 Tom Aspinall

\#13 Junior Dos Santos

\#14 Aleksei Oleinik

\#15 Marcin Tybura

&amp;#x200B;

MATCHUP #1 - Tom Aspinall &amp; Chris Daukaus need to fight each other next.

RESULTS OF THEIR FIGHTS: Aspinall defeats Arlovski via 2nd round submission (rear-naked choke), Daukaus defeats Oleinik via 1st round TKO (punches).

The two newly ranked HW contenders that emerged after tonights KO-filled card, were of course, Liverpool's bright, and entertaining talent in Tom Aspinall, and Philadelphia native, Chris Daukaus. Both Aspinall, and Daukaus showed impressive striking in their pursuit of victory, and while Aspinall did adapt to grappling, his shoot-in on the takedown was pretty impressive. Daukaus was able to defend himself from Oleinik's grappling, both standing, and preventing any takedowns, and an onslaught Daukaus was able to close the fight in under one round, which notably Derrick Lewis wasn't able to do. However, there are the issues with the overall striking of both fighters. I found that Aspinall showed the tendency to strike out of his range, especially when going for combinations, while Daukaus could've worked the body a little bit more against Oleinik. Nevertheless, these were two outstanding performances, and I think that a matchup between Aspinall and Daukaus is one that can help iron out the wrinkles that these two have, and potentially reveal a legitimate threat in the division.

&amp;#x200B;

MATCHUP #2 - Phil Hawes should fight Brendan Allen after his MD victory over Nassourdine Imavov.

Now 2-0 into his UFC career, Phil Hawes surprisingly didn't put France's Nassourdine Imavov away in one round. Instead the fight became a well contested bout on the feet, with Hawes using his often forgot about wrestling chops to control the fight and escape with a majority decision win. Hawes came extremely close to being finished, getting wobbled multiple times in the third round, before halting the offense of Imavov by using the clinch to hang on. Hawes' wrestling, which comes from a D1 background at Iowa State, was impressive, and the overall body strength by Hawes is outstanding for the 185 lb division. Give Hawes a test against fellow Contender Series prospect, Brendan Allen, an outstanding grappler who while unfortunately losing to Sean Strickland in November, still has wins over fighters like Kyle Daukaus, Tom Breese, and most notably Kevin Holland. Both Hawes, and Allen have outstanding finish rates, and perhaps their grappling could cancel out, and present to us MMA fans a slugfest.

&amp;#x200B;

MATCHUP #3 - Yana Kunitskaya upsets Ketlen Vieira, and with that, earns another shot at the top 5.

I predicted that Yana Kunitskaya's grappling work would help her pull off the upset over the strongly favored Ketlen Vieira, and sure enough it did. Kunitskaya is 2-0, with two dominant victories since losing to Aspen Ladd in 2019. With Germaine de Randemie recently finishing Julianna Pena, who is now booked against Holly Holm, the matchup for Yana that makes the most sense is Irene Aldana. Both fighters have wins over Ketlen Vieira, and both are extremely fierce contenders, and despite suffering a setback against Holly Holm, Aldana is still as dangerous as they come.

&amp;#x200B;

MATCHUP #4 - Despite his impressive victory, Derrick Lewis won't be fighting for the title in his next bout.

Derrick Lewis once again defied the odds, and finished Curtis Blaydes, who was the -450 favorite entering tonight's main event. Lewis' 2nd round finish will go down as one of the most stunning wins, and biggest upsets of 2021. However, even with a win like this, I still had the path for the winner of tonight's main event set. In a recent reddit post, I made a hypothetical Grand Prix for the UFC, and if you look at it, you can see who should face who. It's simple: Lewis won't fight the winner of Miocic-Ngannou, because Jon Jones is moving up to attempt to become a two division champion. If Lewis were to wait for a title shot, he would likely be getting it around this time in 2022, which of course is an unfair advantage for him, as seen by the negative effects of a year long layoff. The most ideal opponent for Lewis is the winner of Rozenstruik-Gane, which is being held next weekend. That will decide who will face either Miocic, Ngannou, or Jones for the title. The only way I could see Lewis fighting for the title next, is if either UFC 260 headliner suffered an injury or tested positive for COVID-19, thus creating a potential opening for Derrick Lewis. All in all, it is still looking to be a huge, and unforgettable year for the heavyweight division.

I even downloaded a big package of the early tournaments and still really enjoyed the absolute batshit matchups.  I know that PrideFC has that... kind of pro-wrestley vibe sometimes, and I've enjoyed some of it.  But I still see 'style v style' as entirely separate from the 'real' MMA today. I want the actual *mixed* stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Any recommendations for less well-known or publicized (at least in the US) stuff that might be enjoyable?  Individual fights are certainly welcome, but I would love to see organization or intentional programming to that effect.

Just a few days ago, it cut 9 fighters. And it already purged the roster just two weeks beforehand. And BEFORE that, it released former champions Renan Barão and Anderson Silva and former middleweight challenger Yoel Romero. Meanwhile, former light heavyweight challenger Anthony Johnson and TUF 19 winner Corey Anderson were allowed to defect to Bellator.

So that got me thinking: who could be the most notable victims of the UFC's next roster purge? And two names came to my mind: former flyweight queen Nicco Montaño and TUF 20 winner Ryan Hall. Coincidentally, each person's last fight was on the same day: July 13, 2019.

After falling ill before her first defense against Valentina Shevchenko and being stripped of her title, Montaño went 10 pounds north and was outscored by Julianna Peña, who was returning from pregnancy and childbirth at the time of their fight. Hall, meanwhile, flummoxed Darren Elkins en route to an easy decision win. And since then, multiple planned bouts for each fighter have collapsef for various reasons.

So let me briefly discuss why they could be among the next batch of purgees. Long spell of inactivity? Check. Frosty relationships with the company brass? Check. Unpopularity amongst fans (especially online)? Probably check, at least for Montaño, who did not exactly endear herself to the public during her rather brief reign. But Hall? He can be something special at 145, which is a shame. What do you think, guys?",Will the UFC release Ryan Hall and Nicco Montaño?,53,0

That got me thinking, who would have P4P most heart? 

First, I want to make the distinction between heart and toughness. I do think they are mostly synonymous, but there is a minute difference. It’s hard for me to summise it but if I had to bring a fight up to represent each heart and toughness I would use these examples; toughness - Robbie vs Rory, they both were kicking each other’s ass the whole fight and showed toughness. Heart - (because he recently fought) Derrick vs Volkov, Volkov was destroying Derrick. If my memory serves Volkov won both previous rounds, probably 10-8ing, and Derrick just hoops him with 10 seconds left in the 3rd. I would consider this heart not toughness because Derrick never heals a horse in the race, he had to use heart to never quit on himself, never give up, and to find the resolve to get that late finish.

To summarize I would note the difference between heart and toughness is that you display heart when you’re getting your ass kick and don’t give up, but toughness when it’s a grueling, close fight and neither fighter wants to give an inch.

Now, who would be #1 P4P heart? This is hard for me. I would certainly put Derrick on the list. It’s just hard to measure heart. 5 quick of my nominees are Derrick, Frankie, Tony 🕶, Sakuraba, Bisping

5 quick Toughness nominees - Joanna, Nick+Nate, Poirier, Justin Gathje, Mark Hunt.

What are your guys’ thoughts? Am I defining them toughness and heart wrong? Is there no difference?",P4P Fighter with Most Heart,176,18

I know they have been around MMA for awhile but they have only in recent years become 'popular' and ranked in the top 10. I dont know whether its just hopeful optimism or misplaced optimism but I constantly saw comments and posts about how they are so high level and considered some of the best ufc currently have to offer. IMO their title fights showed the opposite (it showed Khabib and Usman are in fact that).

I remember a quote Diaz made after his Pettis fight (hilariously right in front of Cejudo too) where he said something along the lines of ""we'll see where these new guys are in a few years.. see if they can still hang"" basically downplaying these new champions, because they got early title shots and didnt 'go through the fire' so to speak.  Just because they got the belt doesnt mean they are the 'best', especially if they havent cleared the division. I know Diaz is also not a world beater but he has a point. Fighters who have earned respect and shown they are the best in the world are ones who have remained at the top of the game for years. Not the ones that have had great, but short/fast runs. Technically even Usman and Khabib fall under that category.  Obviously Khabib is retired but we will see where Usman stands in a few years before he can even be considered one of the greats.",Hyping relatively 'new' fighters as world beaters,100,0

Formerly regarded as the best of the best, he has been making substantial blunders (or at least, controversial decisions) with increasing frequency over the last couple years or so. The man is 50 years old now. It's not like he's geriatric or anything, but in terms of split-second decision making, his abilities can't be getting any better. Where as the relatively younger guys like Jason Herzog for example seem to be rising to greater prominence in terms of regard for their performance (I'm sure he's made mistakes, everyone does. But I'm talking consistent and substantial fuckups).

Coy (15-7) is a UFC and Bellator veteran, who hasn’t fought since being released by the UFC in 2017. Woodley and Coy fought at a Strikeforce event in 2010, with Woodley getting the nod by split decision. The 42-year-old Coy competed on season 21 of The Ultimate Fighter and was eliminated early on, the same season in which Usman went on to win.
“The toughest opponent I’ve ever fought was a dude named Nathan Coy,” Woodley recently told Helen Yee “He was actually a teammate of mine at American Top Team. The other guys I fought, I just didn’t perform, or I backed up too much. Nathan Marquardt, I just relaxed for one second too long on the cage and he threw me the elbow buffet.”
Woodley (19-6-1) is currently on a three-fight losing streak in the UFC, dropping his last fights to Colby Covington, Gilbert Burns and Usman. Reflecting back on his fight with Coy, Woodley stated he is the only fighter that has ever matched his level in the octagon.

“But Nathan Coy, I was there,” Woodley continued. “And I was 100 percent and I was going hard and he was going hard. I threw up so bad after this fight. Oh my God, it was so hard, it was such a close fight. I barely won it, but I was fighting as hard as I could and he was fighting as hard as he could. He’s the only one that I’ve ever fought to the level that matched me. Anybody else I fought at 50% or more, I knocked out or beat or snapped them. When people are beating me, I am not even remotely where I am supposed to be at.”",Tyron Woodley said Nathan Coy was his toughest fight. Not Colby or Burns or Nate Marquette,64,69

This is the final part of my intro to my FaST classification models.

You can see the first part of this series, the Strategic breakdown, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/lj3ppm/how_i_am_using_unsupervised_machine_learning_to/):

The below tables are filled with round results for each class and the specific differentiation statistics that separate them. Each value in the table is the average for the entire class across the board.

Once I established a fighter's round Strategic class, I took his/her statistics and run it through one of four Tactical models. One model per Strategic class. Each model was trained on different variables based on the intuitive understanding of what that strategic class was likely to try to do in a round.

Let’s first start off with the Striking Heavy strategic class. In my modeling, I found 3 distinct classes within the Striking Heavy strategic class. The main differentiators for the three classes came in the ratio of head/body/leg strikes as well as how they were combined together. I have outlined them below:

&amp;#x200B;

|Class|Leg Strikes Thrown|Body Strikes Thrown|Head Strikes Thrown|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Head Hunter|3.1|4.6|38.2|
|Tree Chopper|9.9|4.5|18.1|
|Balanced|3.3|10.2|21.1|

As we can see, the names kind of speak for themselves here. The tree chopper class is a very interesting one to me and one that I want to investigate further. I imagine that as MMA continues to develop, these sorts of Tactical classes can be re-run to see if any new classes emerge.

Next, let's talk about Balanced Grappler. Here I found 4 distinct classes. The main differentiators I found were takedown attempts, overall output and ratio of where output is happening. I have outlined them below:

&amp;#x200B;

|Class|Takedown Attempts|Clinch Strikes Thrown|Total Strikes Thrown|Ground Strikes Thrown|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Clinch|2.05|12.1|31.2|2.1|
|High Output|1.9|2.5|35.9|2.5|
|Anaconda|4.1|2.2|14.3|.8|
|Ground and Pound|1.85|2.7|37.3|16.2|

Lots of differentiation here. Since we don’t have deeper breakdowns of what types of strikes were thrown, i.e. kicks to head vs punches to head, we are working at a higher scope.

Up next, Balanced Striker. In my modeling, I found 3 distinct classes within Balanced Striker. Big differentiation at a high level but, like I said above, we can’t drill deeper with present available data.

&amp;#x200B;

|Class|Ground Strikes Thrown|Clinch Strikes Thrown|Head Strikes Thrown|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Ground and Pound|15.2|3.2|19.7|
|Clinch|.7|6.4|13.2|
|High Output Head Hunter|1.6|5.1|27.2|

And last but not least, Grappling Heavy. This is the most highly differentiated class of all of them. Grappling Heavy strategies are differentiated into 5 classes outlined below:

&amp;#x200B;

|Class|Head Strikes Thrown|Ground Strikes Thrown|Clinch Strikes Thrown|Takedown Attempts|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Clinch|5.01|3.2|12.4|2.64|
|Ground and Pound|4.1|21.2|1.9|1.81|
|Head Hunter|10.5|2.1|2.5|1.87|
|Anaconda|2.5|2.2|1.2|4.18|
|Heavy Top Control|8.7|10.4|1.6|1.7|

As we can see, there are many many ways to approach a grappling heavy fight. One of the key things to notice is that we do not have a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) specific class. This is because the data we are working with is striking dominant. We do not have data on guard passes, time in positions, etc. which would allow for deeper dives into BJJ usage in MMA. The other thing to notice is the Heavy Top Control class. This one is hard to separate because it is essentially a fighter with low work rate that lays on his/her opponent for the round. Not much action in these rounds.

First of all, **thank you** to all the juicy ratfricks on this subreddit who took 5 minutes out of their day to help advance academic interest in MMA and its impact on both viewers and global culture more generally.

Because I know no one likes to read walls of text, I'll give you a brief summary of the tools and methods we used, and then get straight to the bullet points t

**Q: ""What is the Intercultural Sensitivity Scale?""**  
A: The Intercultural Sensitivity Scale is a test designed to **measure an individual's attitudes and behaviors during intercultural interactions**.  The assessment uses 24 Likert-scale questions to score 5 dimensions of intercultural sensitivity: 1) Interaction Engagement; 2) Respect of Cultural Differences; 3) Interaction Confidence; 4) Interaction Enjoyment; and 5) Interaction Attentiveness.

**Q: ""What does this have to do with MMA?""**  
A: Great question!  Sports and politics have been inextricably linked all throughout history.  I can't think of a sport other than soccer that has broader international appeal and participation than combat sports, specifically MMA. The impact of the sport on global political and cultural attitudes is critically understudied, especially when one considers MMA's growing population all around the world.

**IN SHORT,** we asked a lot of people about their thoughts and feelings during intercultural interactions, and then asked a bunch more questions about their MMA viewership history, motivations, and outcomes.

**Let's get to the fun part:**

# Demographics

* We had a total of **181 respondents** to our survey
* Respondents were **83% male, 16% female,** &amp; **1% non-binary**
* **80.7%** of respondents are **current viewers**, **4.4% used to be viewers**\*\*\*,\*\*\* and **14.9%** were **non-viewers** (this was our control group).
* The **mean age** of respondents was **26.4 years old**.
* We had respondents from **31 different countries,** with the United States and other Anglosphere countries making up about half of all respondents.
   * This was expected given that the survey was only administered in English and distributed through primarily English-speaking forums.
* Our respondents' socio-economic background and education level are representative of the general population.
* Many of our respondents are **plurilingual,** although the mean number of known languages was still slightly less than 2.

&amp;#x200B;

# Intercultural Sensitivity

* The **mean Total Intercultural Sensitivity Scale (ISS) score of all respondents** was **90.5/110**
* The **mean Total ISS score** for **nonviewers** was **90.1/110**
* The **mean Total ISS score** for **current and past MMA viewers** was **90.5/110**
* You can see there are **no significant differences in Total ISS**

*But wait...*

* When you break it down by dimension, **MMA viewers score significantly higher in Interaction Engagement**, meaning that they enjoy being active participants in intercultural interactions more than the average respondent.
   * When we ran the numbers to see if MMA viewership and Interaction Engagement scores were correlated, we found that they are indeed! (p=0.044)
* And when we break it down by **how long someone has watched MMA** we found that:
   * Being a **long-time MMA Viewer is correlated with higher Total ISS scores.** (p=0.009)
   * Being a **long-time MMA Viewer is correlated with higher Interaction Confidence scores.** (p=0.001)
   * Being a **long-time MMA Viewer is correlated with higher Interaction Enjoyment scores.** (p=0,004)

&amp;#x200B;

# Viewership Motivation

We also looked at ***why*** **people watch MMA**, and what psychological demand/need it meets using a five-dimensional scale developed by Yongjae Kim.

* Mean **Knowledge Application** Score = 12.7/15
   * This reflects how much someone watches MMA because they enjoy applying their knowledge of the sport to predict and breakdown fights.
* Mean **Sports Betting** Score = 3.8/15
   * This is pretty self-explanatory, it reflects how much someone watches MMA because they enjoy gambling on the outcomes of the fights.
* Mean **Vicarious Achievement** Score = 11.2/15
   * This reflects how much someone watches MMA because they feel a sense of accomplishment and pride when a fighter they like and/or support performs well.
* Mean **Arousal** Score = 12.4/15
   * No, not *that* kind of arousal, but rather, how much someone watches MMA because they enjoy the physical and psychological feeling of suspense, anticipation, stress, uncertainty, etc... when watching fights.
* Mean **Socialization** Score = 11.3/15
   * This last dimension reflects how much someone watches MMA because they enjoy the social aspect of watching it, discussing it, and generally enjoying it with others.
* As you can see, **Knowledge Application and Arousal are the biggest viewing motivations** among this sample population. **Vicarious Achievement and Socialization are not insignificant**, but Sports Betting is.

&amp;#x200B;

# Additional Fun Stuff

We presented respondents with a series of statements and asked them to select all that apply to them.

* **The most chosen statement was “I am excited when fighters from new countries are added to the roster”**
* This was **followed closely by “MMA helps to inform me about other countries and cultures.”** **and** then **“MMA has helped me learn to identify other flags and languages.”**,
* These three statements were all selected by more than half of all viewers.
* **“Successful MMA fighters from my country are a source of national pride for me”**, however, **was** only **selected by about 40% of viewers.**

&amp;#x200B;

# Conclusions(?)

Keep in mind that we're not quite done working everything out yet. There are some other interesting trends in the data that we're looking to verify. However, the challenging part with all of this isn't demonstrating where there may be a correlation, but finding exactly what the causal mechanism is.

* The high Interaction Engagement might be due to the fact that those who score highly in it are likely to seek out intercultural experiences, whether that be in real life or through media such as MMA.
* Watching MMA for a long time seems to increase Interaction Confidence and Enjoyment, possibly because, as the selection of applicable statements suggests, people come to learn more about other countries and cultures through MMA media consumption, causing them to feel more confident and at ease during real-world intercultural interaction.
* The two highest viewership motivation dimensions -- Knowledge Application and Arousal -- seem to reflect the dual mind/body engagement of the sport. On one hand, grappling and striking exchanges can be incredibly technical, but on the other, they are adrenaline-spiking, palm-sweating spectacles as well. The low Sports Betting score may simply be due to this motivation not being prevalent among r/mma subscribers, who constituted a large percentage of respondents.

# Final Remarks

This is the first time I've ever run any sort of research experiment involving survey data. My background is more in normative theory than it is in quantitative and qualitative research. I'm fairly confident in my statistics work, as most of it was done in R Studio.

I'd love to hear your guy's thoughts in the comments here though; **How has being an MMA viewer affected your view of other countries and cultures? Have you learned about the wider world through MMA? How much of the sport's appeal is due to its markedly intercultural nature?**

# TLDR

MMA viewers tend to be more engaged in intercultural interactions. After following the sport for a long time, interaction confidence and enjoyment seem to go up as well. You probably watch MMA because you like applying your knowledge of the sport and because it makes you all titillated and you like that feeling.",MMA Viewership &amp; Intercultural Sensitivity | Preliminary Research Results,45,37

A sign-up form can be found at mma-ds.com/Newsletter/New . If you would like to stay up to date on the most advanced metrics MMA has to offer, consider signing up!

**Introduction:**

While working on my Derrick Lewis vs. Curtis Blaydes article, I came to a realization about the tools I have been using. All of my data analysis centers around taking the strategy and tactics of fighters, quantifying it and then seeing how effective it is based upon my judging model. However this does not tell a complete story of a fighter's offensive output. Finish heavy fighters like Lewis were downgraded because they don't win rounds. To go about fixing this, I took a few steps back and asked myself: what are all the aspects of winning a fight at a high level?

A fighter can win by: points, submission, or knock out. My current tools only focused on the first of those three. So how could I incorporate a rarer event into my analysis? Points are easily to quantify because every round is a zero sum game meaning someone has to win. However, someone does not have to be knocked out or submitted on a round by round basis. This makes them rarer events from a probability standpoint. What I figured out was that I could take those probabilities in comparison to the actual results and assign a score to each fighter on a round by round basis that cumulatively would take into account all three win conditions. Shout out to Justin Filteau who identified that this logic is the basis for the Elo chess algorithm. [Here is a link to an explainer on it](https://www.chess.com/terms/elo-rating-chess).

 **Math:**

On a round to round level, I created a data set with 7 simple columns:

1. Weight Class
2. Round Number
3. Offensive Strategic Class (OSC)
4. Defensive Strategic Class (DSC)
5. If fighter won round (1/0)
6. If fighter KO’d opponent (1/0)
7. If fighter Subbed opponent (1/0)

From there, I pivoted the data on weight class, round number, OSC, and DSC. Verbally, this would give us a data set that would say: “at a given round number in a given weight class when OSC x and DSC y faceoff against each other: the probability of round victory is a%, probability of KO is b% and probability of Submission is c%.” So now we have a pretty large data set of combined probabilities with their anchoring features of weight class and round number.

Next, we take that data set and merge it back on the actual results. So in addition to the above 7 columns we add in an additional 3:

1. Probability of winning round on points (PTS)
2. Probability of KO (KO)
3. Probability of SUB (SUB)

Since every round is zero sum, someone has to win, I subtracted the probability of each from their respective actual outcome. The math looks like this:

* If a fighter won a round that he/she had a 40% (.4) probability of winning: 1 - .4 = .6 is their PTS score for that round
* Similarly, if the fighter had lost instead with a 40% chance of winning: 0 - .4 = -.4 is their PTS score for that round

The above concept applies across SUB and KO as well but with smaller probability features since they are rarer events.

I then added up all probability gains across a single row (PTS, KO, and SUB) together to create a placeholder metric that I called oSTeloR for total offensive STeloR score.

Let's take a quick look at an example so we can see how this will look on a round by round basis. For this example, I will be using Israel Adesanya's last fight against Paulo Costa:

&amp;#x200B;

|Fighter|Round Number|PTS|KO|SUB|oSTeloR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Israel Adesanya|1|.5|\-.075|\-.003|.422|
|Israel Adesanya|2|.504|.954|0|1.458|

&amp;#x200B;

Once we have these results on a round by round basis, we can sum a fighter's rounds together and get an overall look at their total, probabilistic contributions offensively. What jumped out immediately to me is that fighters in their prime were heavily weighted towards the top of rankings. To fix this, I figured there were two options:

1. Segment to fighters only with same fight count
2. Segment to fighters only with same round count

I have leaned towards the latter through my research because I feel as though it gives a better picture of overall contribution.

**Results and Discussion:**

Since Ciryl Gane fights this coming weekend, I am going to use him as my example. Ciryl Gane has fought 9 rounds in the UFC so far. In order to compare him to other heavyweight fighters, I have to segment all of their data to their first 9 rounds as well. So! What are the results?

&amp;#x200B;

|oSTeloR Rank|Fighter Name|PTS|KO|SUB|oSTeloR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Junior Dos Santos|4.76|2.33|\-.27|6.82|
|2|Ciryl Gane|4.25|.17|1.85|6.27|
|3|Francis Ngannou|2.87|3.16|\-.23|5.80|
|4|Jairzinho Rozenstruik|3.06|2.45|\-.27|5.24|
|5|Andrei Arlovski|2.52|2.01|\-.15|4.38|

 In terms of combined probability gain: Gane ranks as number 2 all time through 9 rounds trailing only Junior Dos Santos. Wow. Based on this ranking system, Gane is essentially the second greatest heavyweight prospect trailing only a young Junior Dos Santos.

What really stands out is that Gane ranks second all time through 9 rounds as a submission artist. Why is that? Gane has two submissions on his record: a head and arm choke as well as a heel hook. We will dive into this later, but the type of submission, what round it happens in, and what weight class it happens in are both variable and extremely important in determining a fighter’s score in both KO and SUB. I am going to be doing a further write up on Gane tomorrow (make sure to check that out for a deeper look on Gane).

One thing that also stood out to me is that the greatest heavyweight of all time Stipe Miocic was not in the top 5 nor the top 10 through his first 9 rounds. We had to go all to #23 in oSTeloR to find Stipe. That stood out to me as a major red flag in my rankings and deserved a deeper dive.

Looking at Stipe’s record, he has fought 43 UFC rounds and is a multi-time defending heavyweight champion. But what if we split his time in the UFC in half? Let’s compare first 21 round Stipe to last 22 round Stipe and see who ranks in the top 5 at heavyweight in both of those looks:

&amp;#x200B;

|Fighter Name|PTS|KO|SUB|oSTeloR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Junior Dos Santos|7.99|3.21|\-.40|10.79|
|Derrick Lewis|4.20|4.69|\-.78|8.11|
|Fabricio Werdum|4.85|1.27|.28|6.41|
|Alexander Volkov|5.79|.30|\-.27|5.81|
|Cain Velasquez|2.93|2.38|\-1.1|4.21|

Through the first 21, Stipe ranks a whopping 11th and doesn't even show up in our table. Now what if we look at the top 4 heavyweight fighters from rounds 22-43 and compare them to Stipe?

&amp;#x200B;

|Fighter Name|PTS|KO|SUB|oSTeloR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Stipe Miocic|2.39|3.27|\-.45|5.21|
|Andrei Arlovski|5.58|\-1.56|\-.23|3.80|
|Junior Dos Santos|4.36|\-.85|\-.20|3.31|
|Fabricio Werdum|4.26|\-2.58|1.62|3.3|

Wow! Not only is Stipe #1, his cumulative oSTeloR is greater than 37% higher than second place Andrei Arlovkski.

This leaves open tons of potential. Prospect rankings, a series on greatest peaks, best championship runs, all kinds of awesome content that I will be putting out!

The last point I want to hit on before I close this out is something I discovered while researching all time middleweight rankings.

&amp;#x200B;

|oSTeloR Rank|Fighter Name|PTS|KO|SUB|oSTeloR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Anderson Silva|7.46|3.22|.37|11.05|
|2|Thiago Santos|4.26|4.82|\-1.22|7.86|
|3|Israel Adesanya|4.11|2.12|\-.03|6.19|

 

This comparison is fighters at middleweight through their first 21 rounds. As we can see, Thiago Santos incredible power puts him a bit above Izzy in total oSTeloR. But more interestingly, Thiago has a much higher negative SUB score than Izzy through the same number of rounds. Why is that?

I broke down the round by round data and realized this was a perfect demonstration of the value of these probabilities. Israel fights as a predominantly stand up fighter and his opponents choose to fight him the same way. Because of this, he naturally has a low probability of submitting his opponents. Thiago however mixes in more grappling and takedowns. His probability of submission is thus higher but he has not capitalized on it enough to gain score thus he lost score. This too opens up tons of possibilities for further discovery.

**Conclusion:**

STeloR is a first of its kind ranking algorithm that combines all aspects of offensive performance and compares them on a probabilistic level. To really take the predictive power up a notch, I will be building out a defensive version that should encompass all aspects of fighter performance. With a little more research, these scores can be combined with a few more data points to improve upon all current predictive algorithms.

If you guys didn’t have a chance yet, make sure to take a look at my [Strategic Classes](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/lj3ppm/how_i_am_using_unsupervised_machine_learning_to/), [Tactical Classes](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/lshta1/how_i_am_using_unsupervised_machine_learning_to/) and new [STeloR algorithm](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/lsym7r/introducing_stelor_the_first_predictive_offensive/) which provide added context to the analysis I am doing here!

This week's main event is sure to be a firefight. Cyril Gane vs Jairzinho Rozenstruik.

**Visual Scouting:**

First up Gane. Ciryl Gane looks like if you added a heavyweight frame to a highly technical middleweight striker keeping all of the speed and agility. Cyril Gane, in my opinion, looks like the most talented mixed martial artist at heavyweight not named Stipe Miocic or Jon Jones. He is a highly technical kickboxer yet has serious, serious submission skills. Skilled distance fighter who has the technique, hand speed and raw power to put you away if you close the distance. He has exceptional striking defense which was exposed vs Junior Dos Santos but otherwise he has simply outclassed every opponent he has faced. Cyril Gane is what I imagine a young, pre-USADA Alistair Overeem would’ve looked like had he not had his supplements.

&amp;#x200B;

Jairzinho looks to me a lot like a kickboxing centric version of Derrick Lewis. Power dependent and lacking in any real weapons if the fight hits the ground. Rozenstruik also has a tendency to fight flat footed at times. Movement will be one of his main weapons to combat Gane so he doesn’t have any leeway in this regard. One big thing to note is that this fight will be in the APEX which will affect Gane’s ability to fight at distance since the cage is smaller. Overall, I don’t have much to add on Jairzinho that hasn’t been said already by others.

Here are a few links if interested from other great creators:

**Data Analysis:**

With the introduction of my STeloR algorithm, I am going to switch up the format of data analysis to keep it from getting stale. Instead of adding in tables for every class I will only highlight the interesting areas and summarize the rest through text

From a strategic standpoint, Gane presents as a striking heavy fighter that mixes in some grappling when the opportunity presents itself. My model has him never losing a round in his 9 UFC rounds fought. All of his opponents choose to go striking heavy with him and all have failed so far.

Jairzinho also shows up as a striking heavy specialist, he has used this strategy in everyone of his fights to date. He however only wins these rounds at a rate of 62.5%.

&amp;#x200B;

|Defensive Strategic Class|Number of Rounds|Win %|% of Total Rouns|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Balanced Grappler|4|25%|50%|
|Striking Heavy|4|100%|50%|

Here is where we see the interesting splits. Jairzinho has won only one round where his opponents mix in a balanced grappling approach. While not something Gane has employed much, I have see in my visual analysis that he has a strong arsenal of clinch trips that could take Rozenstruik to the canvas.

From a tactical standpoint, Gane shows a near even distribution of rounds between head hunting, balanced and tree chopper which, from a data perspective, shows his skilled all around striking portfolio. 7/9 rounds, opponents try to fight Gane as a striking heavy head hunter. He wins all of these rounds and has shown in the past that his head movement is on par with that of the middleweight comparison I made earlier. While he can be caught, Gane is a much more skilled defensive striker than his average heavyweight counterpart.

Jairzinho splits his tactical rounds near evenly between headhunting and tree chopper. He won 2/4 headhunter rounds and ⅔ tree chopper rounds. From an opponent’s perspective, grappling is how to beat Jairzinho in the points column. His combined score in rounds that are Anaconda, ground and pound or clinch is a 25% win percentage.

Now, let's factor in some of the results from the STeloR algorithm. As was written in my write up on the algorithm, Cyril Gane rates as the second best Heavyweight prospect behind Junior Dos Santos through 9 rounds:

&amp;#x200B;

|oSTeloR Rank|Fighter Name|PTS|KO|SUB|oSTeloR|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Junior Dos Santos|4.76|2.33|\-.27|6.82|
|2|Ciryl Gane|4.25|.17|1.85|6.27|
|3|Francis Ngannou|2.87|3.16|\-.23|5.80|
|4|Jairzinho Rozenstruik|3.06|2.45|\-.27|5.24|
|5|Andrei Arlovski|2.52|2.01|\-.15|4.38|

He accomplishes this mainly due to his massive contributions in winning rounds as well as his submission game. Jairzinho’s weakness in the grappling arena could for sure be exposed by Gane. I question the likelihood that Gane gameplans for grappling however. I believe Gane can outstrike Jairzinho so I doubt that he will try to bridge the distance and take down Rozenstruik especially after the end of last week’s main event (Blaydes vs. Lewis). Gane does not rank highly in the power arena however, coming in a 38 out of 117. This is partially due to a bad non-stoppage in the first round of the fight against Don'Tale Mayes. However, that fight led to the heel hook in the 3rd which showed his all around game and contributed to him being ranked 2nd as a submission threat through 9 rounds. 6 of one half dozen of the other.

Looking at Jairzinho, he has fought in 12 rounds. He ranks 3rd in KO probability, trailing only Derrick Lewis and Francis Ngannou. That is fantastic company for a KO artist at the highest level (all results are through first 12 round of each fighters career).

&amp;#x200B;

|Fighter|PTS|KO|SUB|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Derrick Lewis|3.46|3.4|\-.58|
|Francis Ngannou|2.86|3.16|\-.27|
|Jairzinho Rozenstruik|3.56|2.86|\-.36|

However, Jairzinho is a much superior points fighter compared to Francis and slightly superior to Lewis. He ranks 3rd in points through 12 rounds whereas Lewis is 4 and Francis is 11. This speaks well to Jairzinho’s ability as a striker but when we consider that Ciryl has a 20% higher cumulative points score while having 3 less rounds than Rozenstruik, it is my opinion that it is unlikely Jairzinho wins this on points.

**Conclusion:**

Cyril Gane looks like a world beater at heavyweight to me. I have not seen many heavyweights that move like him while having such high technical skills. I would not be surprised to see him win another one or two and face the winner of Jon Jones vs whoever wins the heavyweight title at UFC 260. Jairzinho Rozenstruik, like Lewis, has a boom and bust heavyweight win style. He could knock Gane out with a tricky punch in the first minute and all of this analysis would be for naught. However I try to write these articles without the flash KO in mind. Gane’s striking defense, movement, striking offense portfolio and superior ground game give him the edge in every category that isn’t power. I see him winning the fight and since it is at heavyweight, I predict he does it in under 5 by KO or submission. I am taking Gane by KO/TKO or submission which Fanduel has -120.","Ciryl Gane vs Jairzinho Rozenstruik, a Data Science and Analytics Breakdown",7,56

I know have missed some, I also need to remind you that these are just bad stoppages with too much aggression, Herb had other funky and weird calls, which I am sure many of you can attest to, most notable being just letting Conor cheat. You will also notice a rising trend, there is definitely more funky finishes and decisions the later we go on.

I’m an adult that’s new to boxing (2 and half months ) my couch told me to help with my defense to grab a kid in the gym have them throw punches at me so i could build better defense . So that’s what i did i got a very experienced kid (state champ) to throw punches not ashamed to say that this kid who’s over half my age younger got some nice punches in . 

Right after training i had a headache that lasted the rest of the night . Next day still had a slight headache and some tense spots . 

So my question is ; is this something that happens regularly should i not be worried or is this a sign of a concussion . As he was hitting me there never was a moment that was like damn this hurts it wasn’t till i got the headache i started overthinking myself to death . it seems even a punch from a kid without headgear can cause damage ?Either way i don’t plan on stopping i find this sport very fun but i would like to know if I’m overthinking .

note: many ranked fighters such as Wilson Reis and  Jussier Formiga have been released and others such as Louis Smolka and Sergio Pettis have moved up to Bantamweight.

The numbers represent the rank of the fighters and all are in order. For example, Fig beat the number 4, 2, 12 and 5 ranked fighters in that order. He beat the number 4 most recently and the number 5 first. However, each section (win, loss) are in their own order (obviously).

14. Mudaerji: 25, 5'8

15. Nam: 37, 5'7

**III. General State**

God of War and Assassin Baby will fight once again in three months time while the winner of Askarov and Benavidez will most likely be the next contender.

The top of the division looks almost brand new; almost none of them have fought each other. The stats section however, shows at least some movement as God of War's spectacular fights have seemingly gained the division some interest.

Currently the top of the division is dominated by two people: Figueiredo and Moreno. Askarov's fight this week should give us some insight into how worthy he is but IMO he's also at the top.

I usually dont judge people based on one fight but Benavidez was completely outclassed twice by God of War, so depending on how you see it hes either right there at the top or the gatekeeper for the forming elites.

Perez, Pantoja and Royval have each lost to one of the top three.

Outside of them theres not much to review since they just dont have enough fights against each other to paint an accurate picture.

As for prospects: Dvorak and Albazi are both 2-0 in the UFC. Su Musaerji is one of the most entertaining strikers in the division and is 3-1. Tagir Ulanbekov is 1-0 but 12-1 overall so he may be one to watch as well. Manuel Kape lost to Pantoja but it was his debut against the number 5 ranked UFC fighter. He can still do well. Tyson Nam is also very interesting.

Edit: Ah, I see I forgot to write a conclusion. Well, this is my second favorite division. I feel it's going to be a very interesting one soon enough. 3 fights are happening this week. One to determine the next number 1 contender, one between two men ranked equal and one with an old veteran of the division against an unranked fighter.","Current State of the Flyweight Division, Broken Down in Three Sections",40,58

Considering the amount of fights he’s had, does he have the lowest official knockdown in UFC history? (Not including guys who also have a 0% rate but less fights)

Also he may have KD’d someone unofficially, but I haven’t seen all his fights so idk for sure. 

And also yes, official MMA KD rules r stupid, but just for the sake of this statistic/question, go along with it.

Some fighters u may think had more but don’t include

Jon Fitch. Has scored 2 knockdowns, which automatically makes him have a higher %

Dominick Cruz. Has scored 1 knockdown, which makes the same case as Jon Fitch

Jake shields also has a 0% rate, but less fights, even including strike force.

Demain Maia amazingly has 1 KD scored in his career, which disqualifies him too

So is there anyone else, or does Aljo rly have the least knockdowns scored per fight in the UFC?",Why Aljo Might have the Lowest KD rate in UFC history,110,111

But recently it seems like the level of striking has taken leaps in the top tier of the UFC. Try and put together a list of the top strikers today, guys like Max, Izzy, Wonderboy, and Conor are typically at the top the list. But there are more and more guys who should be considered on that same tier imo. 

Yan, Volkonovski, Figgy this feels like a new generation of champs who are all very, very good strikers. Then you’ve also got guys like Dustin and Jan who outstruck those S tier strikers like Conor and Izzy. As for as mma striking goes they have to be considered on the same level. 

Even more crazy is they all are very stylistically different. You have volume boxers, KO artists, defensively sound kickboxers.

Obviously he knows a lot about MMA and 10 years ago he was one of the most knowledgeable guys out there, but I feel at least in the last 12 months he's either made big fuck ups during broadcasting (saying Jan was a middleweight) or in some of his podcasts good prelims fighters have been mentioned and Joe doesn't have a clue who they are (no specific examples, but I've heard it a few times lately on jre with guys he should absolutely have heard of if he kept his finger on the pulse). 

100mil will change us all and he's been a commentator for years so maybe he's just a bit over it. I've been watching ufc for over 10 years and watch every fight, but I certainly don't pay as much attention to every fight as I used to. Joe sounded like he'd checked out last night and whilst he's always had a predetermined narrative going into fights that he sometimes refuses to adjust, the Izzy Jan commentary was another level of biased. It seems like Joe and DC now spend more time trying to be funny and push UFC narratives than they do evaluating the fights. 

I was sad when Goldie got fired, but honestly maybe Joe's time should be coming to an end too. The only problem is there aren't really any great replacements, unless they put Trevor Wittman in who I think could be amazing at it, potentially along side Felder and Anik.",Is Rogan now a casual?,73,1

From what I was hearing, Aljo was on the path to a decision loss, taking a lot of damaged and was exhausted. As much as I wanted him to win, it sounds like he took a LOT of punishment, and likely wasn’t taking this one.

Then Petr Yan pulled out the worst move he could, and (redacted)

The instant reaction from my companions was both “what the fuck PETR” and “get up Aljo you POOSAY!” And so I was left kinda confused.

We all watched the same fight, right? The one where Yan was dominating Sterling, and hit him with an illegal move that concussed him and forced him to stop fighting?

As MMA and UFC fans, it’s never entertaining or rewarding to watch a fight be determined by a disqualification. I personally would have given this fight to Yan on performance, but to pretend that Sterling was supposed to just bounce back up after getting bombed in the head while down, AFTER all the punishment he took, shows me that the fans who are mad at him are not thinking logically.

Aljo was concussed, and as manly and badass as it would’ve been for him to shakily stand and say “I got this.” It’s just not consistent with context of having just been concussed while a person is gassed. Being mad a downed opponent who wants to fight( Aljo was pleading to fight but couldn’t because the stoppage) and not at Yan (who apparently had to ask for the rules mid championship fight) screams “I WATCH UFC CAUSE BIG MAN PUNCH PUNCH”

try gassing out during a fight, getting your ass kicked, give it your all anyway, then get bonked in the side of the head with a shovel. I’ll ask if your corner is ready to throw you back in against the champion.

My final thoughts: Yan and Sterling are both top tier fighters, and minus the result this was a very entertaining fight. Yan showed more fighting intelligence which would’ve edged him the win, if not for an illegal knee to a downed and defeated Sterling. Blaming Sterling for not continuing shows little remorse to his health, and undermines his effort that got him in that fight in the first place.

I wish Aljo a speedy recovery, and hope Yan really learns from this!",Aljo deserves more respect,49,1

*disclaimer: I only watched the fight once, with the biased commentary on.  My scoring may be a little off what some of you have, but the principle of this thread remains.*

Justification: this weekend was a great example of why 10-10 needs to be used more often.  In the fight, we had two *very* close rounds at the beginning of the fight, a pretty clear Adesanya round 3, and a crystal clear Jan rounds 4 and 5.  Some judges scored the last round 10-8 for Jan.  While this is stupid, I understand why they did it - Adesanya did not convincingly win any round.  He probably eeked out round 3, but did he win rounds 1 and/or 2?  Did he lose them?  Honestly, they were very close.  So the judges, on the fly, were trying to adjust the scores to reflect that the last two rounds were the only convincing rounds of the fight.


The proper way toward better judging in MMA and boxing is to use a draw round when the round is very close.  If there isn't a clear winner, score the damn thing a draw.  There are a LOT of rounds where people are feeling each other out, where two guys go to war and no one breaks, where - simply, no one has started to take over.  Often we have to get to the later rounds to see a clear winner emerge.  This is what happened in this fight.


This type of scenario is handled well by say, the pride scoring system, but not in our current one.  Therefore, the judges felt like they had to do some dumb shit to properly weight those final two rounds.  However, the problem is not really with the RULES of our scoring system, but the spirit of it.  From what I understand, judges are instructed to score a winner for each round at all costs.


Below is what I feel is the proper scoring for the fight:

RD: (Adesanya-Jan)

R1: 10-10

R2: 10-10

R3: 10-9

R4: 9-10

R5: 9-10

Final score: 48-49 (Jan)


This could be a step toward improving scoring in many fights.  There are a lot of three round fights that are honestly super fucking close.  We don't need a winner for every damn fight.  There's no use in putting an L on a guy's record cause one guy MAYBE landed like an extra jab, or maybe one guy had a takedown but didn't do jack fucking shit with it and got punched from the bottom.


I believe that increasing the number of draws in this sport will cut down on the number of robberies.  You can always run it back if its a draw, but if its a loss, one guy may get set way back because of suspect judging.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on this.

**What happened? Is a fatigue was a factor why you made this decision \[to throw knee\]? Was it intentional?**

No ofcourse it wasn't \[intentional\]. I didn't had a malice or bad intention. Just there was a moment, before the fight, when the referee was explaining \[grounded\] fighter rule in locker rooms. He was making big focus on hands part \[of the rule\] and I got too focused on this \[part\]. Like you can't hit if palms are flat on the mat, but you can hit if its just fingers. To be honest I didn't even saw his knee was touching the mat.

**You know there was similar situation in a fight early, when you did it \[throw knee\] more precise and accurate.**

I thought when he would lift his hands I could hit. You know, in this moment I thought he was squatting, that he wasn't on his knee, but squatting and ready to stand up. I thought I was allowed \[by rules\] to hit.

**I feel like you was leading the fight, did you felt the same?**

Yes I did. In my opinion 3 or even 4 rounds were mines. And I did that mistake \[knee\].

**Was it easy to parterre \[with Aljo\]?**

I wasn't too focused on parterre. Quite the opposite, I wasn't following gameplan when I did \[grapple with Aljo\]. But you seen \[the result\] yourself.

**Do you think rematch is logical option \[for current situation\]?**

I don't know and its not up to me to decide. Its UFC's \[decision\]. But in my opinion rematch is the most logical decision for current situation. I don't see any other outcomes.

**What you feel right now?**

You know, honestly... confusing situation. I can comprehend and at same time I can't comprehend what just happened.

**Did you liked your performance? I think you outclassed him in grappling \[exchanges\].**

Lets not talk about it \[performance\] right now, I need to watch the tape... but I know one thing - I didn't follow the gameplan \[grappling with Aljo\].

**What was the gameplan then, by the way?**

Gameplan was grapple as minimum as I could. In perfect scenario don't grapple at all. But in later rounds I realized he's \[Aljo\] not so strong, not that big... I knew I can do it \[grapple\] and try something new.

**Did you felt you could finish him and end the fight without scorecards?**

Well, finish is... its comes naturally and I try not to think about it \[finishing\] too much or force it. But yes, during the fight I felt, that it will be in 4th or 5th for sure.

**Did you and Sterling spoken after the fight?**

No, last time I seen him was when he was laying there \[on mats in the cage\], probably dying, I don't know.

**Do you think he was faking?**

I don't know. Ask him. I think I need to analyse the whole situation, right now. I don't want to make assumptions and tell wrong conclusions.

**Did you felt anger \[when threw the knee\]? Not only during fight and that moment, but was it some bad blood between you both?**

No, no like I said I was too focused on his hands, I thought he gonna put his arms up \[from the mat\], ready to stand up and I hit. That it.

**So it was complete freak accident?**

Yes, you know it was just a hunt. Fight, nothing personal.

**Do you watched the replay \[of the fight\]?**

No, I didn't seen anything.

**Do you have a wish do to do it at all or you just want to forget and not remember that mess at all \[means Yan may not be in the mood due to disappointed result\]?**

I'm not trying to say he won when he had the worst odds, but consistently being overlooked and being the underdog in 9 of his past 10 fights all the way to becoming the champ and then defending against undefeated Izzy. His last 5 fights have had closing odds of roughly:  


Luke Rockhold (-225) vs Jan Blachowicz (+225)

Ronaldo Souze (+145) vs Jan Blachowicz (-145) \*the one time he was the slight favorite

Corey Anderson (-210) vs Jan Blachowicz (+210)

Dominick Reyes (-239) vs Jan Blachowicz (+220)

Israel Adesanya (-225) vs Jan Blachowicz (+225)

&amp;#x200B;

He has also been the underdog in 12 of his 16 UFC fights, winning 9 of those 12 fights. He's not perfect, he hasn't won them all, but he's consistently overcoming the odds and making people lose a lot of money! So I'll ask the question again, is he one of the greatest underdogs in UFC history? Let me know what you think!

Beyond this, everything else is up for debate. Some are inclined to denigrate Sterling, or at least the system, for awarding the title to a fighter they feel was clearly on his way to losing. It’s odd how quickly we forget that in MMA, virtually anything can happen. For example, on the very same card we saw Kai Kara-France score a first round stoppage after being in serious trouble on the ground prior to that point. Sure, it looked like a fight Sterling was going to lose, but the fight isn’t lost until the final bell or until a fighter is stopped (legally). 

Several people, fighters included, have accused Sterling of faking or acting in order to win by disqualification. I admit there are things about his behavior in the short term after the illegal strike that, intuitively to me, didn’t look genuine. There is no doubt that the knee connected with great force, but you simply need to compare the end result with the result of the knee Marlon Moraes landed against Sterling to be reminded what things look like when a fighter (Aljo himself in fact) gets well and truly rocked by a knee (legal or not). 

When I say some things didn’t seem genuine, I’m talking about stuff like the way Sterling was putting his hands over his eyes, squinting, then making wide-eyed looks, while still moving around and being able to answer questions from the doctor about his vision, etc. On a gut level, some of it just seemed... embellished? The thing about gut-level intuitions is that whatever comes first will color everything that comes after. For example, did the way Aljo was wobbling when he stood up look genuine? Maybe, but it also just could have been a better job of embellishment. (This is a great time to point out that intuition can often be very wrong.) 

The problem with intuition is that everyone is naturally inclined to justify their intuitions. So if your gut tells you Sterling looked like he was embellishing, you search for reasons to explain why he would do that. The obvious answer is, *“he was losing the fight and this way he gets the title by DQ.”* You could pretty much wrap that up with a bow for most people because the intuition is being supported by a pretty logical justification. Once somebody is there, it's pretty hard to change their mind. You can bring up the fact that any fighter would have to know they’d be viewed as an illegitimate champion afterwards, but then it will spiral off into arguments about how it’s financially better to be the champion in the rematch, etc. (Which are also very very logical arguments). Basically, you’re only going to convince someone who’s intuition is that Aljo’s behavior didn’t seem genuine by giving them another justification for it not being 100% genuine (regardless of whether or not their intuitions are correct to begin with). 

All that got me thinking about other reasons a fighter in that situation would embellish the effects of an illegal knee? Full disclosure: it’s possible the only reason I was inclined to do so could be that I intuitively like Sterling and I’m therefore searching for reasons to justify continuing to do so. So again the fact, he was hit cleanly with an illegal knee. I myself have never had that misfortune, but I have been solidly hit in the head a few other ways and I know there can be myriad effects. 

It’s reasonable to think that a lot of fighters believe there is a chance to win a fight they are losing. It’s reasonable to think that a fighter would not feel good after taking a hellacious knee to the cranium. It’s reasonable to think that the effects such a knee could destroy any belief a fighter had in their ability win the fight. In a situation where they know they needed every little bit they had left - they had some of that taken away. The unfortunate (?) thing for Aljo in this circumstance is that his body didn’t show us any **undeniable** signs this was the case. For example, if the result of this knee had been anything like the Moraes knee, no one would be saying a damn thing about whether he could have continued. In fact we'd probably be talking about whether he should retire.

So what do you do as a fighter in this situation? This is where the weight of expectation comes in. *Put yourself in his shorts.* You are fighting for the UFC title on PPV and you take an illegal knee to the head that eliminates - for legitimate reasons - any chance you thought you had to turn things around in a really tough fight. It’s affected you physically and mentally. But you didn’t lose consciousness. You didn’t stiffen up into a fencing pose. Compared to those types of reactions you seem to be doing alright, neurologically speaking. You want to keep fighting, *but you don’t want to keep fighting like this*. You don’t feel right. But nobody can see how you feel. The doctor, the referee, and the audience can’t see inside your head. They need to know you don’t feel right. So you start to do things that all of us recognize as non-verbal signals of physical discomfort. You do this also because your intuition says that if you just sat down and calmly said, *""Sorry, I don't think I can continue. I really don't feel right""* everyone would 100% call into question your behavior (and that intuition would probably be correct).

The problem is we, as spectators, recognize those non-verbal signals of discomfort because we use them ourselves. Except we use them when we tweak our ankle in a pick-up basketball game, or because we missed a box jump and bashed our knee in the last round of a workout. Maybe for the first second or two, we really thought we hurt something, but now we just want an extra breather. Maybe we’ll sub out or call it day. No biggie. The difference is we, as non-fighters, can take a breather. We can half-ass the rest of the game and then hit the showers. We can finish those last 10 reps carefully and still have gotten a decent workout in. In neither situation, does a really angry Russian guy come out and start punching us in the face. Nor is either activity our professional occupation. In other words, we think we know what we’re seeing, but we don’t, not really. 

TL;DR - just because it may have looked to you like Aljo was embellishing does not mean that he was, but more importantly, even if he was embellishing, it doesn’t mean he was doing so for the same weak-ass reasons you or I do it.",That's F*cking Illegal: In Which I Think Too Much About Yan vs. Sterling,6,1

I'm a late 30s man and have zero experience in combat training. I'm also a lifelong smoker and my lungs are really starting to deteriorate. I'm somewhat fit (excluding my lungs). I think if I was in an actual MMA fight, I'd be puking from lack of oxygen and exhaustion within 2 minutes of the first round. 

I've been in a few fights in my life, but I've never really tested myself and I'd like to use that as motivation to quit smoking. 

There is a local guy that I know that runs BJJ and MMA programs, he's actually fought in Bellator and I am sure he'd have no issues accepting me for his cost. I just don't want to sign up for something I'm not ready for.

I am pretty sure that I've torn a rotator cuff and I've been slowly nursing it over the last year, but never visited a physiotherapist. It's gotten better, it doesn't bother me. But I think if I tried to throw a baseball or something, I'd probably reset my progress to day 1.

So - is there anyone out there with any advice that's maybe been in a similar situation, or a coach or MMA trainer?

My thoughts right now are:

Go see a physiotherapist about my shoulder before I pursue this - and strengthen those muscles because throwing a punch is basically the same thing as throwing a baseball.

Build up some cardio and shed a few lbs so that my lungs aren't going to be taxed as much

So take Bryce Mitchell vs Charles Rosa
Mitch had top control with I could see getting him point for position but his submission attempts were all blocked by Rosas defence does that mean Rosa has better defence therefor should be given more points.

Serra during TUL was talking about how he’d get down on 1 knee so that the opponent can’t kick or knee you, Chris Weidman also abusing this against Gegard by putting his hands on the ground and trying to get him to throw an illegal strike so he can win via DQ, he even said he couldn’t see and when they asked him what month it was, he said wrong month on purpose so he’d get DQ win, and the scummy Serra and Longo are on the sidelines talking about ”Stay down, he’ll get DQ, you’re hurt” to weidman. However, when they said it was a legal strike, suddenly he says the exact date and somehow has regained his “lost” vision.


Now Aljo doing the same damn thing, when he got tired, he just gets down and stall and prays that the opponent throws an illegal strike, if he would’ve done it once or even twice, it would have been that bad, but he did it like 5 times ffs. 
I’ve never seen anybody act like that after getting rocked or even KO’d, and i’ve seen alot of them in the gym, he kept blinking and acting like he was completely out of it, as if he coulnd’t stand for a good 5 minutes, hell, even the doctor said he didn’t even get concussed, but he’s acting like he’s been killed and revived by getting up and then falling down again, like cmon man. Then we got Longo over here, holding him when the result got announced, acting like Aljo couldn’t even stand, so cringe and sad behavior.

Yes, it is a rule that you can’t knee a downed opponent, but ffs, remove the rule, people are abusing it at this point, especially this team, i feel like this rule could change alot of thing in the UFC and also make things more exciting.

Don’t get me wrong, i loved Aljo and thought he’d walk through Yan, but the fact that he was acting like that after the fight really turns me sour man.

First, Megan Anderson announces on Twitch that the UFC is shutting down its women's featherweight division. Then the UFC denies those claims, saying that the division's fate is still in the hands of double champ Amanda Nunes. Of course there is still the Felicia Spencer-Danyelle Wolf fight, but for this discussion, let us assume Spencer decides she will go 10 pounds south after the fight.

That leads us to the following scenarios:

* If Nunes decides she is done with 145, that is it. Spencer-Wolf will be the last fight in the division. The result will not matter.
* However, if Nunes decides she is not done with 145, the fate of the division will hinge on the result of Spencer-Wolf, and the UFC will most likely tell her that. Here are the possible scenarios in this case:
   * If Spencer wins, that is it. Women's featherweight is done. Spencer has already lost to Nunes at 145 (though both of GdR's losses to Nunes were at 135), and as I hypothesized before, she is shedding 10 pounds.
   * However, if Wolf wins, she will get a title shot, and that will be the last fight in the division, regardless of the outcome.

While Dana White admits to the truth of the claims made by the fighters and has made instagram posts commenting on the situation in the past, in a classic move Dana White takes the victim blaming position that these fighters made their decision and didn't need to succumb to Hans' odd requests.

By breaking fights into individual rounds, xR more meaningfully captures judging uncertainty, measures fighter dominance, and rewards finishing ability - which enables improved fighter evaluation. This post uses Magomed Ankalaev's UFC debut as an example of what xR can show us.

This post seeks to provide a clear example that illustrates both (a) what Expected Rounds (xR) is and (b) why xR is needed in this sport. If interested, my prior [Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/m0w6pg/introducing_expected_rounds_xr_a_new_advanced/) more formally introduces xR. I also have a [Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/NateLatshaw/status/1367979028238467076?s=20) that covers the very basics of this metric, and I have a [blog post](https://literalfightnerd.com/posts/2021-03-02-introducing-expected-rounds-xr/) that thoroughly covers all the details.

# Defining xR

Drawing from Expected Goals (xG) in sports like hockey and soccer, Expected Rounds (xR) is a new advanced MMA fighter evaluation metric measuring fighter dominance that improves upon conventional metrics (like win % and finish %) without sacrificing interpretability. 

Put simply, **xR is the number of rounds a fighter would expect to have won, on average, given his or her round-by-round performance.** This means that xR essentially divides up the credit for each round between the two fighters based on how likely each fighter was to win that round on the judges' scorecard.

For a given fighter and round, xR is defined as follows:

(a) If the fighter is finished during the round: xR = 0

(b) If the round goes the distance: xR = fighter's round win probability, as computed by a [machine learning algorithm](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/iy2z3i/introducing_a_new_fight_evaluation_tool_a_machine/) that leverages round-level striking and grappling statistics to predict judges' scores

(c) If the fighter earns a finish during the round: xR = 1

**Dividing a fighter's total xR by the total number of rounds fought yields Expected Round Percent (xR%), which is the percent of rounds a fighter would expect to have won, on average, given his or her round-by-round performances.**

There is uncertainty in how judges score each round. The xR paradigm acknowledges that judges will possibly not score identical rounds the same across time and attempts to account for this uncertainty. Hence, xR% can be thought of as the percent of rounds each fighter would expect to win if a given fight was fought identically many times. That is, if a 5 round fight was fought identically 20 times (for a total of 100 rounds), an xR% = 80% would mean that that fighter would win 80 of the 100 total rounds on the judges' scorecards. 

My claim is that, even though it is not perfect, xR% offers an improvement over conventional fighter evaluation metrics like win % and finish %.

Let's run through an example to see how xR works.

# In-depth Example: Ankalaev vs Craig

Magomed Ankalaev is a promising prospect in the Light Heavyweight division, but he lost his UFC debut to Paul Craig via submission in the third round. Thus, after his first UFC fight, Ankalaev's UFC win % and finish % were both 0%.

His UFC debut lasted 14 minutes and 59 seconds. How valuable are UFC win % and finish % as metrics used to evaluate Ankalaev as of the end of that fight? I'd argue that they are not very useful. At that time, we had nearly 15 minutes of UFC fight time on Ankalaev, and using win % and finish %, we could not distinguish him from any other fighters who, for instance, got quickly and easily submitted early in the first round of their UFC debut.

**Not all wins and losses are created equal. We need a metric that can account for that. That is why I believe MMA needs xR.**

The screenshot below shows the stats by round for Ankalaev's UFC debut. We see he clearly won the first two rounds and generally dominated the third before being submitted.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dn632c4wi9m61.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8643358426d9b3005f160ded49add95812437fd5

The xR metric is computed by round and is displayed in the table below. Recall that xR is calculated using the probability that each fighter would win each round on the judges' scorecards (as computed by a machine learning algorithm I developed). Below we see that Ankalaev earned the majority of the xR available for the first two rounds, which properly rewards him for his dominance in those rounds. However, since he was finished in the third round, Ankalaev does not earn any xR for that round, which punishes him for his vulnerability to that submission.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/vr7n673yi9m61.png?width=600&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9423feeb5071e0b09966efa59b08a7f6af1a883f

Now we aggregate xR to the fight level to evaluate each fighter's performance. The figure below shows each fighter's  xR% for the fight (computed by dividing total xR by three, the number of rounds fought) and each fighter's win % for the fight. Which metric is more informative here?

I'd argue that xR% is clearly the more informative and valuable metric since it properly rewards Ankalaev for his dominance in the first two rounds but then punishes him for getting submitted. Also, xR% would allow us to compare Ankalaev to others who lost their UFC debut because it measures performance by round. Hence, a fighter who was dominated in all 3 rounds of his debut would have a lower xR% than Ankalaev. In fact, since Ankalaev actually earned the majority of the available xR for the fight (meaning his xR% &gt; 50%), Ankalaev could have a higher xR% than some fighters who won their UFC debut, which reflects Ankalaev's dominance in the first two rounds of the fight.

Relative to xR%, win % is not designed to capture nuance, and as a result, does not provide as much useful information.

&amp;#x200B;

[xR&amp;#37; and win &amp;#37; are presented for this fight only \(not each fighter's career\)](https://preview.redd.it/mri5pzjzi9m61.png?width=392&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e914cd36a2e2bf713322a037911625b7342cc7a8)

Finally, notice the gap in informational value that is present between xR% and win % in just this one fight. Now imagine how wide that gap could grow across all fights in each fighter's career and then across all fighters in the sport.

**We need a metric that (a) rewards both dominance and finishing ability, (b) punishes both being dominated and being finished, and (c) distinguishes between dominant wins, close wins, and judging blunders. The xR and xR% metrics, while far from perfect, do all of the above.**","Clarifying Expected Rounds (xR), a new interpretable fighter evaluation metric: what xR actually means and why you should use it",23,1

So Hunto knocked Struve clean out so if height isn't the predominant factor in a victory over Slender Man, then what about weight. How low in weight can we go before the sheer length of Struve is too much.

The team that scores the most win. In MMA you tend to score certain thing in your mind. Commentators (ie Rogan) for whatever reason around 2008ish started just straight up telling us who they thought won the round or who was winning (and thereby who could win the round).

Everyone does it now. Really only Cruz doesn't tell us who won the round. Rogan, DC, Bisping, Felder, etc. literally all explain who they think is winning.

The thing with other sports is that because there's a literal score, you cannot influence the perception of the results. If you do, people will call you an idiot. If you say, ""yes, the Patriots have dinked and dunked their way downfield 4 times for touchdowns, but the Chiefs had that one 80 yard bomb, they're outperforming the Patriots"" you look stupid. Because of the subjective nature of MMA, people can just agree and think anything and everything is arguable.

1.I've heard that I should choose basically a good base(ex. boxing or may Thai for striking &amp; BJJ or wrestling for grappling is that true ?

3. Should I just do MMA instead of MT or Kickboxing first then moving on ? Because I know in a street it almost 95% of the time ends up on the ground so I know I'll need a ground game but I don't want to waste time training 1 thing for long then having to go learn another style

For me its:

**Stand-up**: Straight forward basic Boxing skills &amp; Calf Kick since they are in again lmfao

**Physically:** Good Cardio in exchange for KO Power (Probably lil boring for entertainment value)

**Clinch:** Be good at getting to the back and get them to turtle position &amp; mat returns

**Takedown:** Single Leg (Be at least better at finishing Singles than Double Legs)

**Ground Bottom:** Good Half Guard recovery to either sweep or initiate a scramble

That company wants to own Trevor Wittman's patent exclusively while Wittman wants it to be allowed for all. I believe other gloves outside Wittman's design also helped prevent eyepokes, such as Pride gloves.

I believe the best thing for the UFC would be to call for a breach of contract in that they failed to do what was reasonably required (prevent eyepokes) due to fundamental design flaws which tend to push the fingers open by default, unlike others which tend to pull them together.

When you're striking, it's expected that your fingers remain bent. One warning and then a point is deducted. If an eye poke ends a fight, it's an L for the poker. It's hard to listen to the ""accidental eye poke"" excuse that is constantly given by the UFC commentators as this is cut and dry. Most of these pokes are not occurring in situations where fingers need to be extended (ie. during or defending a takedown), they are occurring during striking exchanges and are intentional. If the UFC cracked down on it harder, we wouldn't see this going on.

• Khabib's body composition and athletic performance DRASTICALLY changed around 3 years ago in terms of size, strength, and endurance.

• He had many troubles with injuries in his career and almost retired because of them, however, all of those injuries magically disappeared around the same time that his athletic performance and body composition changed drastically and have not reappeared since.

• He cuts a drastic amount of weight (has struggled a great deal in making weight for fights many times because of it) yet still continues to have an abnormal amount of endurance compared to his opponents (usually cutting a lot of weight equals a difficult time on the body making it hard to have stamina i.e. TJ Dillashaw publicly stated he took EPO because he felt no energy after cutting weight to fight Henry cejudo and some fighters state that they choose to fight in a more natural weight class to maintain endurance).

• However, some speculate the real reason that he withdrew from one of the five Tony Ferguson scheduled bouts was becuse he got blood in the liver due to a side effect of EPO use and not because of a weight cutting issue.

• He typically only fights once a year and pulls out of a lot of fights, which many argue is the pattern that fighters taking PEDs follow to avoid a lot of testing and also to coincide with peaks and lows of PED use.

• In a survey conducted by Athletic.co last year, many fighters called-out USADA for being inaffective against Russian athletes &amp; fighters doing camps in Thailand. Khabib already has a edge over his American counterparts, since he stays in Dagestan, where the randomised testing aspect of USADA is completely lost. Not to mention, Russia's infamous doping program, those who have watched Icarus must be aware of how all that worked.

• Many of Khabib's intimate friends and training partners from Dagestan (who potray themselves as religious &amp; humble like Khabib) have tested positive for PED use (Zubaira Tukhugov, Islam Makhachev, Ruslan Magomedov, Mairbek Taisumov etc.). Ruslan Magomedov actually tested positive for PEDs so many times/red handedly that he is actually the first fighter in history to be banned by USADA (and his body composition was not that different to Khabib's post body transformation).

• Khabib's close friend and manager Ali Abdelaziz was allegedly part of a steroid scandal with Judo in the Olympics. The same close friend and manager tweeted ‘If you are an UFC fighter out there and USADA tried to call you and tried to talk to you directly, Never do that because there job is to get suspensions, it's them or us.”, which many felt was a broadcast to all of his fighters saying basically “keep quiet and don't snitch”. In addition to the aforementioned Dagestani teammates of Khabib, another athlete of Ali (Fabrício Werdum) also tested positive for PEDs as well.

• He has a large strength and endurance advantage over his competition (some of whom are probably on PEDs as well).

Absolute bullshit these guys don't know the rules but even casuals/fans like myself know better. Yan threw an illegal knee is a CHAMPIONSHIP match, Eryk Anders threw the exact same knee Yan did last week (he threw 2 illegal knees). Then we got this inactive title-shot wannabe who throws 2 illegal eye pokes, even after being warned, and somehow gets to skate off with no real reprecussions.

Despite this weekend being a really fun card otherwise, we absolutely need to see some changes. New scoring rules for fouls, bigger punishments after verbal warnings. You could even give these guys a written test like the DMV does before they let you drive.

It was a mistake but he threw the knee deliberately, this is ambiguous at best and is something that not everyone seems to be able get used to, I'm not excusing it but eye pokes seem to be more in the realm of cup shots in that they fall into the realm of 'occupational hazard'.

I just wanted to share my two cents on a sport I have always loved. It's a sport that demonstrates the pinnacle of human athleticism, combining strategy with adaptability during the match, and it overall highlights supreme physical abilities and showcases years of dedication/training in multiple disciplines.

That being said, I hate how much the sport relies on (fake) drama to attract fans to a fight. Pretty much a single person acts as a regulating body (Dana), which is horrible because it just opens him up to clear bias. And there's the added issue of underpaid fighters that aren't allowed sponsors because of Reebok.

All in all, I feel like the MMA (and especially the UFC) is this hybrid of WWE and an actual sport. The big boy on top decides who fights who, usually depending on who has the best trash talk and doesn't even shy away from explicitly showing his bias towards certain fighters.

First off, all credit to \[[@NumbersMMA](https://twitter.com/numbersmma?s=21)\] on Twitter, who is the source of most of the descriptive stat breakdown and visualizations I post on this sub. Give him/her/them a follow if you enjoy numerical MMA analytics.

&amp;#x200B;

[Advanced stats for Brunson vs Holland](https://twitter.com/numbersmma/status/1371463082418044931?s=21):

# Striking:

||Brunson|Holland|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Strikes landed/min (accuracy)|3.8 (41%)|6.98 (55%)|
|Strikes absorbed/min (defense)|3.47  (59%)|3.86 (60%)|
|Strike differential|0.33|3.13|
|For/against knockdown rate|1.59%/1.72%|1.06/**0.0%**|
|Strike efficiency (relative to the expected baseline)|\-2.15%|\+19.92%|

Numerically, **Holland has a clear advantage in the stand-up**. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a more lopsided comparison. Holland dominates across almost all numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

# Grappling:

||Brunson|Holland|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Takedowns landed / 15 mins (accuracy)|2.8  (28%) |1.37 (50%)|
|Takedowns allowed / 15 mins (accuracy)|0.0 (**100%**)| 2.75 (53%)|
|Control time/Opponent control time (percentage of. fight)|32.48%/1.17%|22.28%/30.55%|
|Sig strike attempts per control minute |6.67|7.25|

While Holland has decent and more efficient grappling offense, Brunson has much better grappling defense, more offensive grappling output, and much greater ability to control. The numbers alone suggest this to be the clear route to victory for him because the striking numbers are bleak.

&amp;#x200B;

[Another nugget concerning Brunson’s elite but under-sung wrestling defense](https://twitter.com/numbersmma/status/1371465327716995075?s=21):

There are 312 fighters who have at least one UFC bout and have never been taken down.  Only three have 100% takedown defense while facing over 15 attempts:  

Kamaru Usman (20 attempts) 

Dan Stittgen (17 attempts) 

Derek Brunson (16 attempts)\]

&amp;#x200B;

[More on their striking comparison](https://twitter.com/numbersmma/status/1371568868460797957?s=21):

When striking from distance, Kevin Holland absorbs 0.39 strikes per minute more than Derek Brunson (3.86 vs 3.47)

It was November 12, 1993 when UFC 1 held its first event. A Grand Prix style tournament, winner moves on, last man standing is given the Title of the Ultimate Fighting Champion of the World. Now this process has evolved and elevated way past the point of it’s origin as a sport and entertainment. Even the athletes have reached what seemed to be an unimaginable level of mixed martial arts now as opposed to those who competed in UFC 1 in 1993. But I still go back to watch the early fights of the UFC, not because it’s better, but because the lack of weight classes is so intriguing to me. I would love to see this happen in the UFC in today’s age. Fighter’s IQ is at such a height level now and I would love to see some of the fights but I will never get to see them because of weight classes. 

Proposal:
I think that if Uncle Dana wants to entertain, and make a lot of money, November 12, 2023 is the perfect time to start a no weight class Grand Prix style Tournament to see who is actually the Baddest Man on the Planet! 20 years to the day after UFC 1, we begin the no weight class Grand Prix. Imagine the fighters who would be interested in gaining this title! Imagine all of the dream matchups that we might be able to see. I think that we may see fighters as low in weight as a traditional lightweight fighter all the way to heavyweights. Hell some might even come out of retirement just for the envy of wanting to be the one to reach what I would see as the highest Title in UFC history. Months of fight cards filled with money fights. Just think about the last few fights, you would need to host them in a football stadium because so many people would want to watch it live. Pay per view numbers would be through the roof. And as a fan, we all get to see what we could only dream of. Once you get a set number of fighters who have been hand selected, you host a live press event where names will be drawn to see how the bracket will be laid. I could go on to give every little detail but uncle Dana can contact me if he needs any help.

So Dana as a huge fan of the sport and the organization, please make this happen.",UFC BADDEST MAN ON THE PLANET,16,1

I look on the underside of the wire and see [this](https://imgur.com/a/1fXTJIs)

Apparently it was hanging next to the tire and the tire was just scraping against it. 


I taped it up with electrical tape and taped the wire to the frame. Thing is, it still cuts off when I nudge the wire a little. Surprisingly, it no longer cuts off when riding it but a light nudge to the wire with my finger reproduces the symptoms I had. 


So what I *thought* was happening is that this [frayed yellow phase wire is touching against the exposed blue phase wire](https://i.imgur.com/pyVRmxc.png) when I bend the cable. However...I'm not so sure because I taped it up pretty tight. So theoretically it shouldn't be possible for the exposed/frayed wires to touch because there isn't any room for them to move around. 


I have seen that some hub motor wires can be easily disconnected and replaced but I am not sure if mine can. The only potential area of the cable that I see that looks like a disconnection point is [this](https://i.imgur.com/b01iixq.png) but I don't want to go pulling on stuff it isn't. 


Any thoughts about what could be going on and possible easy fix? I would like to get a new wire if possible but I don't want to take apart the motor when the damage is actually along the cable.",Hub motor wire partially shredded,3,1

Let’s look at the top contenders:

1.) Max Holloway: Lost his title to Volk, then lose a close rematch before putting on an all time great performance against Kattar

2.) Brian Ortega: Was finished by Max in his title fight. Sat out for 22 months before fighting Zombie and winning 5 months ago. He gets a (deserved?) title shot next weekend.

3.) Zabit Magomedhsaripov: Last appearance was an ok win 16 months ago vs. Kattar. Has not fought since, and currently is not booked to fight nor reported to be in negotiations for any upcoming fight.

4.) Last appearance was an “ok” win over Jeremy Stephens 17 months ago. Has no fight scheduled not is reported to be in negotiations. 

5.) Korean Zombie: Lost to Ortega 5 months ago

6.) Calvin Kattar: Took a tremendous beating in his previous loss to Holloway.

Ok, so obviously the problems with this division are twofold:

1.) Zabit and Yair don’t fight.

2.) Max is clearly the best of the contenders but he’s already fought Volk twice.

So, what’s it all mean? If Volk beats Ortega next weekend, there is no doubt that the only deserving challenger is Max. This leads to Max vs. Volk #3. If Max wins, it’s basically impossible not to then schedule a rematch for Volk right away.

The FW division is about to go through a 3 year stretch that consists of Volk and Max fighting for the title over and over unless Ortega can win.",Let’s talk about the current state of the men’s FW division.,8,1

Conor himself is probably a top 6-8ish best LW in the UFC. His ranking is just unjustified based on resume but is at least attached to reality a bit.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Robert Whittaker if he didn't blitz and mixed in wrestling
2. Yoel Romero if he didn't screw around and used his wrestling differently
3. Kelvin Gastelum, because their first fight was so close
4. Marvin Vettori, because their first fight was so close
5. Derrick Brunson, because hes having a bit of a resurgance

My personal opinion is that Jan Blachowitz basically did what Romero tried but couldn't execute, which was to counter strike Izzy and lull him into a false sense of security and win rounds via few big punches and opportunistic takedowns. So the Romero rematch is most intriguing, although its not available anymore.

Part of the problem may be that the narrative is somewhat against Izzy and we say ""well he should have done this or that"", what do you guys think?",Adesanya has nearly cleared out the division yet has sooo many intriguing re-matches,22,1

Hans Molenkamp is the ""Director Combat Sports"" for Monster Energy and decides who gets and keeps a sponsorship.

Monster sponsorships allow a lot of fighters to make a living! He uses this power to force fighters give him cloud and kiss his ass, stage videos where he dominates them during sparring or push his personal brand and projects with the money of Monster Energy.

If they refuse he takes away the money and even tries to use his influence to fuck up their lives.

If you have twitter, share it, tag monster energy! buy another energy drink, whatever! this must end and as stated, most fighters arent able to push this matter because they need the sponsorship and are afraid of repercussions!

And the two times it has been the headliner, the event was on either TV (TUF 26 Finale) or a streaming service (Fight Night 156 in Uruguay). Heck, even the women's 115 title has headlined a PPV (237). And before Jorge Masvidal was announced to be getting his main-event rematch against Kamaru Usman, Weili Zhang-Rose Namajunas was poised to headline 261, and may be repositioned as such if something goes awry with one or both of the welterweights.

So I wonder: will the women's flyweight champion (Shevy, Andrade, or whoever) ever headline a UFC PPV? And why? What will it take to convince the brass to put the 125 queen on top of a PPV card? Let me know below.",Will the UFC women's 125 title ever headline a PPV? And why?,77,1

But, I do digress. It is now time to make the matchups after UFC 260, let's go.

SPEED ROUND

Abubakar Nurmagomedov: Gabriel Green (liked Nurmagomedov's standup, would love to see his overall skillset against Green).

Alonzo Menifield: Michal Oleksiejczuk (Impressive win for Menifield using the famous Von Flue choke from his last opponent, OSP. I think he matches up well with Poland's Oleksiejczuk, who controversially won his fight against Modestas Bukauskas just a few bouts prior to Menifield's.)

Jamie Mullarkey: Uros Medic (Obviously a fighter with a ton of power at 155, Mullarkey just got a huge victory of the bonafide Khama Worthy. A fight with the brilliant Uros Medic will lack a ton of Mullarkey...haha)

REST OF THE FIGHTS

* Miranda Maverick defeats Gillian Robertson via unanimous decision.

Miranda Maverick: Andrea Lee or Maycee Barber

Miranda Maverick weathered the storm against Gillian Robertson, and was able to overcome the Canadian's savvy grappling skills to get her first ranked victory in the UFC. Maverick will have a number next to her name come Tuesday, thus opening up possibilities for her to move up the rankings. Her two best opportunities are likely Andrea Lee, who is currently on a bit of a skid, losing her last three bouts, or Maycee Barber, a fellow right-side-of-25-er that has lost her last two bouts by decision, and desperately needs to get back into the win column. The latter is a really good looking fight in my opinion. Both fighters have high pressure styles on the feet, and Maverick's grappling IQ can create new elements in the possible fight with Barber.

* Sean O'Malley defeats Thomas Almeida in Round 3 via KO

Sean O'Malley: Marlon Vera II, Raoni Barcelos, or Song Yadong (allow me to explain)

SUGA SEAN O'MALLEY IS BACK. The mentally unbeaten star showed off an absolutely impressive striking game with the constant movement we've seen in stars like Cory Sandhagen, the defensive mechanisms (head movement) of Dominick Cruz (maybe), and the one punch power of Garbrandt or Font. I may be stretching it a bit, but I'm just super happy that O'Malley is back in the win column. The next move for O'Malley should be a shot at the rankings, and with a bout against Raphael Assuncao a bit too far up for Suga Sean with the amount he has accomplished, I think he should try and break back into the rankings with a rematch that sounds much better when you really think about it. Marlon Vera's last victory was of course against Sean O'Malley, he won the fight by compromising his leg, getting him on his back, and finishing him with vicious elbows. However, since that fight, Vera has re entered the loss column with a defeat against former 145 champion Jose Aldo last December. Who knows, maybe this fight goes completely different than the last one. Raoni Barcelos is another option. Barcelos recently got a FOTN victory over Khalid Taha, getting a UD win. Barcelos-O'Malley would make for an absolute war, and possibly the next ranked contender at 135. Then there's Song Yadong, the Chinese prodigy, and pro fighter since the age of 15, who just lost to Kyler Phillips, a teammate of Sean O'Malley. Song's toughness would definitely push O'Malley to really calculate what he wants to throw, and this fight could be an amazing one as well.

* Vicente Luque defeats Tyron Woodley in Round 1 via submission (D'Arce choke)

Vicente Luque: Leon Edwards or Nate Diaz

Vicente Luque's chaotic and violent run through the welterweight division has now lifted him next to the top contenders in the division, thanks to his 1st round finish of former champion Tyron Woodley. Luque is just one finish away from tying Matt Brown for most finishes in WW history, and he's already tied Matt Hughes, one of the greatest to ever do it. Luque is in position for a huge, attention grabbing fight next. The best option is Leon Edwards, of course that is, if Edwards doesn't rematch with Belal sometime this year. I think that Luque's style would really bring out a much needed boost in output from Edward's that could finally help the Brit earn some damn respect. It's a really good striking matchup on paper, with the calculated efficiency of Edward's, and the violent style of Luque. Vicente's second option, which is his preferred one, is the one and only Nate Diaz. As a general of the Nick Diaz army, Nate has become one of the most beloved figures in MMA history, a ruthless brawler with an S tier bottom game, he's one of the most difficult fighters to finish in the business today. Luque-Diaz is a FOTY candidate indeed.

Tyron Woodley: Release or Retirement

This obviously comes to the surprise of absolutely nobody; zero; nada; zilch. Tyron Woodley's time the UFC is done, and his long run with the company ended on a FOTN rewarded bang, unfortunately seeing Woodley get put away with the same choke that helped him get his last victory in the UFC. There is absolutely nothing for Woodley in the UFC now, and I more than expect Dana to sit down with him soon, and give him the hard talk.

* Francis Ngannou defeats Stipe Miocic in Round 2 via KO

Francis Ngannou: Jon Jones (possibly for UFC Africa)

He did it. After two years of waiting, and decapitating, Francis Ngannou has reached the pinnacle of combat sports, and has won the UFC heavyweight championship. The Ford Escort is now the baddest man on the planet. Francis Ngannou's growth has been flat out mind boggling. Thanks to his vast improvements in his overall game as a mixed martial artist, Ngannou silenced all the people commenting 50-45 leading up to this rematch. My early prediction is this: Francis Ngannou will be the P4P number one fighter in the world, and he's going to achieve that by decapitating Jon Jones, and sending him back to 205. Dana &amp; company, you missed out on booking Adesanya-Jones, so it's more than the right time to make Ngannou-Jones. Book it for this summer, and have it headline UFC Africa. Potentially in Johannesburg, Auchi, or Lagos. Simple as that. Cheers, Ngannou!

Stipe Miocic: Alexander Volkov

That was a tough one. Stipe Miocic has now lost his title for the second time in his UFC career, and after amazingly being able to absorb some soul taking haymakers from Ngannou, a clean left hook was too much for Miocic, and he was done in two. While a lot of people are vouching for Miocic to fight the winner of Ngannou-Jones, I disagree. The way Stipe lost this fight was absolutely one sided. If he does fight Francis again, make no mistake he will lose again. If he fights Jon, then that is a different story. I think that a great fight is Russia's Alexander Volkov. Volkov has won his last two bouts by 2nd round TKO, beating Walt Harris, and Alistair Overeem, using his intense pressure-driven style to create a claustrophobic environment for his opponents. Also, Volkov has some of the best TDD in the UFC, so a clash between Miocic and Volkov for the top contender spot is stylistically a brilliant one.

sugar sean o'malley got a lot of crap for not going for the kill in round 1. 

Ngannou (again) has gone ham to smash a clearly unconscious human into the ground.

&amp;#x200B;

I KNOW!

""just bleed! they have to fight till the ref stops them"".

I get that.But when the enemy is clearly out, whats the point of this other than showing that you are not that great of a human being.

This is just something that is taking years of the life of another human being. Especially if you get hammerfisted by a ford. (or any of the big heavyweight guys)

How can the rules change to protect the fighter?

There is not really much that can change, is it?

Because sometimes its such a thin line between ""alright its over"" and ""ah he came back after he hit the canvas"".

mma is the game of milliseconds.

So, another era dawns upon the greatest division. Heavyweight, where the baddest man on the planet is crowned, has a new king and this one looks like he could be here for a while. For Bellator's HW division I mostly covered hard facts and straight stats but facts and stats won't do this division justice so let's just dive in and look at what's going on.

This will be broken down into 3 sections.

1. champion, contenders, and elites.

2. the upper echelon. Consisting of gatekeeper(s) and those right outside the elite, not limited to the top 15

3. the body of the division. the rest of the UFC heavyweights. This section many will be uninterested in but there are a few who shows promise. Since there will be a lot of movement (many fights in the coming weeks) they deserve their own post. I will cover this section in part II.

Notice there is no section for prospects this time. I will point them out as they are whether they're residing in the upper echelon or the body of the division. Without further ado, let's begin.

**I. Contenders and Elites**

Champ: Francis Ngannou.

Contenders/Elites: Stipe Miocic, Derrick Lewis, Curtis Blaydes, Ciryl Gane, Alexander Volkov. Maybe Jon Jones.

The situation is simple. Ngannou has defeated Blaydes, lost to Lewis and is 1-1 with Stipe. Gane and Volkov are new additions and so is Jones. Theres a healthy list of new additions.

Derrick Lewis is the man on the 4 fight win streak over 2 top fighters, one unproven (Latifi) and one great elite (Blaydes). Blaydes himself was on a 4 fight win streak over three top fighters and one elite. Ngannou reminds me of Goldilocks. Fought Stipe, was too wild. Fought Lewis, too tame. Now hes found a rhythm that's juust right. How will this juust right Ngannou look against the god of the punchers chance? We might get to see this as Lewis is the rightful heavyweight contender but he may not be Ngannou's next opponent.

Jon Jones's situation is as vague as ever. There are currently money problems with Dana. We shall see how it goes.

Stipe Miocic. Legacy wise, hes done enough for many to consider him one of or the greatest heavyweight of all time. Hes also 38 and has been through more than a decade of wars. If this lowly fan were to give his honest opinion, I would advise for Stipe to learn from the Cormier trilogy and ride off into the sunset after passing the torch. A rematch wouldn't be prudent. He was simply outclassed in every aspect of the fight, even in striking and at 38, it's a bit too hard to learn enough new tricks to bridge that gap. This also is not a performance that gives weight to a rematch without him fighting someone else for it. It can't be Lewis though, Lewis has done enough to deserve arguing with Jones for the next shot. It can't be Blaydes, Blaydes is on a loss and should fight down instead of up. Gane or Volkov would absolutely make sense but first, let Stipe rest.

**II. The Upper Echelon**

Gatekeeper: Jairzinho Rozenstruik.

Upper Echelon: Shamil Abdurakhimov, Walt Harris, Augusto Sakai, Chris Daukus, Marcin Tybura, Blagoy Ivanov, Tom Aspinall, Sergei Pavlovich, Alexey Oleynik, Andrei Arlovski, Ilir Latifi.

Surprising amount of fighters here huh? I think this roster wont significantly change. Daukus is trying to move up but I just don't see him beating anyone above Bigi. Aspinall needs experience so his next fight will be with another veteran at this level. Pavlovich is still out from an injury but he should be healed by now, though his next fight will almost definitely be with someone here as well. As for the veterans, who knows what will happen? At this level there are fighters of every type so rating them together is impossible, we will have to really look into it and study each of them individually.

Last time I put **Jairzinho** as one of the elites. Make no mistake, Rozenstruik is a beast (a quick guide to Bigi Boy [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/lrg3fa/jairzinho_rozenstruik_im_ok_with_jones_skipping/?utm_source=amp&amp;utm_medium=&amp;utm_content=post_num_comments) scroll down a bit and my block of text will appear). However, the twin wins that solidified him as an elite are against previous gatekeepers Overeem and Dos Santos and the two losses are against Gane and Ngannou. Until he earns a win over another elite, he's their resident gatekeeper but at 33 and only 13 mma fights he still has potential. By comparison, Stipe's 13th fight was Fabio Maldonado.

**Chris Daukus** is still underrated by many (me included) due to his flabby physique but did he just beat a 43 year old. He wants a higher ranked opponent though and who better than Rozenstruik? With no Junior and Overeem as gatekeepers, you have to just jump in. As for **Alexey Oleynik**, he is 43. The guys had some success but it's time to hang em up.

**Augusto Sakai** has a deceptive record. He won a split decision against Ivanov but grabbed the fence at a pivotal moment. Many felt his win over Arlovski was a robbery. His next fight is on **5/1** against fellow top 15 Shamil Abdurakhimov. This is a very important fight for him. If he can win without controversy he will solidify his position as a top 15 UFC fighter. He is 29 years old though, there is still time to improve.

**Shamil Abdurakhimov** is 39 and has competed in MMA for almost as long as Stipe (much much longer if you count his sanda career) He has had 8 bouts in the UFC but there are almost no discussion posts about him. The existing ones paint him as boring. Nevertheless, he is a National Master of Sports in Wushu Sanda and an International Master of Sports in Kickboxing. Hes got fast hands, likes to clinch a lot and is tough opposition for Sakai.

What to say about **Blagoy Ivanov**? Hes 34 but his body has endured a lot. Hes on a 2 fight losing streak. Maybe it's time for him to take on someone a step down in the rankings. Pavlovich perhaps.

**Walt Harris** and **Marcin Tybura** will fight on **6/5**, both are veterans of the sport. Walt is a heavy handed banger who goes hard in round 1 and loses steam in round 2. The well rounded Tybura goes at the same moderate pace in every round but it takes him a while to get his opponents timing down. If he can weather the storm early on, he can win this fight and extend his win streak to a very impressive 5.

**Aspinall** and **Pavlovich** are the two most promising prospects in this section apart from Daukus. Aspinall showcased his physical abilities. Though he proved himself too green for a jump forward, at 27 he has all the time in the world. Pavlovich lost to Overeem but it was one of those losses that would benefit you in the long run. He was young, it was his debut against an elite of the UFC and he learned what he lacked (ground game) and what the top of the division feel like. It's time to fight someone ranked above him.

**Andrei Arlovski**. What a man. After a long and illustrious career he reinvented himself and is STILL WINNING! And against decent competition no less. He also looked good against Aspinall. That said, he has chabged his style from ""win at all costs"" to ""a win is a win"" so I dont know where he goes from here. Will he be cut? Will he out point another prospect? Who knows.

**Latifi** is fighting Boser. He lost his only fight at heavyweight but it was go Lewis and he didn't look particularly bad. It's too early to judge him.

&amp;#x200B;

Why?

\- He's very adaptive and intelligent.

\- Besides his native language, he also speaks French and English.

\- He's relatable and has perspective as he's lived some of the worst experiences.

\- He'll be a national hero by the end of his career and will be able to stand for something without cutting deals/playing into establishment politics (example is Pakistan's Imran Khan).

\- He wants to help the next generation in his nation (setting up his gym) and wants to champion/represent Africa (bringing UFC and opportunities to Africa and building ties with the other two of the 'African 3').

\- He's got to the top so quickly, there's way more he can aspire to achieve (he's also unlikely to sustain much damage given his track record).

\- He'll be rubbing shoulders with the global elite now that he's heavyweight champion, much like Mike Tyson did.

\- His presence demands respect (he's literally the archetype of the 'leader of the tribe'.)

But, for me personally, often times on here it feels like there is too much emphasis placed on it, especially when it comes to calling for a fighters retirement. I understand with a fighter like BJ Penn, as an extreme example, who has way too many bad losses that he really shouldn't be put in there with UFC calibre athletes to receive even more damage, but I've seen people call for the retirement of fighters like Whittaker after the Izzy loss. A fighter at his physical peak takes one bad KO and they should ""ride off into the sunset"" (a phrase I hear often, and also definitely makes sense that someone should abruptly stop a career they've worked their whole life on to... I guess live off money that probably won't last them close to retirement). I'd be interested in hearing what others think. And also how this applies to someone more unclear like Stipe who is 38 and has been KO'd 2 times in his last 4 fights, but may still beat the top of the division and is 1-1 with the current Champ.",How much discussion should be had about CTE and fighters retiring?,11,1

He's an amazing ambassador for the sport and an icon of what hard work can lead to. I'm also a big UFC fan. With that in mind, it was both painful and exhilarating to see Francis' dominating performance. 

Can we still say Stipe is the GOAT? I feel like so much has changed due to the demolition Ngannou put on. We started talking about Stipe as GOAT when he beat Francis in 2018 (just 5 fights ago) when he set the HW defenses record, and especially when he won the DC trilogy. 

In those last 5 fights, Stipe was the betting favorite just once (DC #1). Betting odds aren't a great measure but there are a data point. By comparison, a true GOAT like Amanda Nunes usually like a -400 favorite. Even Nunes' #2, Cyborg, is a -400 favorite when fighting anyone but Nunes. At LHW, Jones has averaged as a -491 in his last 15 fights; all for the title.

As we speak, Jones is the betting favorite in a hypothetical fight vs Stipe, and of course of Stipe gets a rematch with Ngannou the betting line will be like 4 to 1.

And, if Francis wins his next two fights and they are Jones+Stipe... then who is the HW GOAT?

Fedor's insane prime cannot be ignored. Coleman, Arona, Goodridge, Arlovski, Cro Cop, Nog and basically 31 straight wins as a HW to start his career, jimminy.

You can say Stipe is 38 now, and out of his prime. But then, when exactly was his reign as the GOAT? Just for like 5 fights against two dudes who also beat him? We've talked about Jones and Fedor as GOATs and then they reigned for 10+ fights after. Personally, I think the GOAT is unclear at the moment. If Jones, Francis or Stipe go on a big run, then it's clear. But of the 3, it's least likely Stipe will, would you agree?

He has lost DECISIVELY to Max Holloway on two occasions, and it's not like he was old at the time of the fights, like a lot of people seem to think just cause he had been around for so long - he was 31 at the time of the first fight and turned 32 at the time of the second fight. If anything, he was at his prime. Max was 25 and had just turned 26 the day before the second fight so he was not even in his prime, I believe now he's in his prime after that Kattar fight. So just from that alone, how could you possibly pick Aldo as GOAT at FW?

The Max fight is, in my opinion, the most glaring example of the fact that he just isn't the FW GOAT and there are also other fighters who have stronger arguments such as Conor (yes he does - fight me) and Volkanovski. As much as people want to call the Conor fight a 'fluke', which is utter nonsense, because we could literally say that about any knockout ever where the guy gets rocked or just knocked cold from one punch, Aldo LOST. Conor has never lost a fight at FW and he ran through essentially everyone before winning the title. Despite nOt DeFeNdInG tHe BeLt, tell me exactly WHO would beat him? ESPECIALLY at the time when he was coming up, 100% hungry and motivated.

Volkanovski, on the other hand, has also beaten Aldo and he also beat Holloway twice so with what logic can Aldo be considered better than Volkanovski? Aldo was 32 at the time so again he definitely is not too far out of his prime. Volk never lost to anyone and basically, like Conor (but with much less knockouts lmao), has ran through everybody thus far. He proably doesn't have enough fights yet, but he's beaten the absolute best of the best, the only people left might be Ortega (who lost to Holloway) and maybe Zabit? But Zabit hasn't fought in almost 2 years, and for no apparent reason either but he seems like a BEAST, idk how much his potential is but he is very very good.

The bottom line is this, you definitely have two fighters in Max and Conor who are quite clearly better than Aldo as they both have BEATEN him and then there's Volk who has some serious GOAT claims as he beat both Aldo AND Max (twice). So you can argue between Max, Volk and Conor, but I certainly believe Aldo is completely out of that conversation.",Aldo GOAT at FW?,40,1

Additionally, this class action lawsuits picking up steam Dana and the UFC are going to start feeling a lot of real pressure when it comes to fighter pay. All the documentation is out there showing what they pay and it's 15-20% of revenue, significantly lower than any other major sports organization.

It's been a controversial topic for many years but nobody has had the cajones to speak up and settle it. Well, I'm here to lead us into the next era of MMA by settling the question of utmost importance:

Are juicy asses a good base for MMA?

Let's look at some key points of evidence to start off with. Tyron Woodley, in his prime, looked unstoppable. He had an absolutely deadly right hand and was solid on the ground. Many may think this was due to his training or technique. But could it be due to the juicy booty he's packing?

Let's take another example: OSP. This man has incredible skill with the Von Flue choke and was a serious contender for a long time. There may be no juicer ass than his. Confidence? You tell me.

Now let's look at what happened at UFC 260. Main event of Stipe vs Ngannou. On paper soany people thought Stipe had it because he was more technically skilled than Ngannou. But what was everyone missing? That's right, the blessing from behind. Francis had a SIGNIFICANTLY juicier ass compared to their first fight. Surely way juicier than Stipe's. And now look who we have as the new HW champion. Coincidence? Again, try to prove me otherwise.",Time to settle the MMA science,6,1

So for this breakdown I watched Paddy’s most recent 2 fights, mostly because he’s only fought 3 times since September 2018, two of those times in the past year.

Pimblett vs Davide Martinez (March 20th 2021)

Straight from the go in this fight I am concerned about Paddy’s striking defense, it seems he’s a bit slow to react several times in this opening minute, not trying to overreact, just stating what I am seeing. I think he is staying a bit too much in range and needs to utilize his front kick better. Every time he’s in range he ends up with his hands down as well, he must quit doing this if he wants to be successful at 155 in the UFC. 

Paddy is starting to find his range with his front kicks now, Martinez is backing him up against the cage, it seems Paddy backs straight up whenever pressured, this also must be fixed. Paddy is now going forward after getting backed up and tagged, Paddy fakes a front kick to the body and goes to the head and rocks Martinez, Paddy immediately swarms him, Martinez backs up just to receive a flying knee from Paddy, which he tries catching and clinched Paddy just to get thrown into side control. 

Paddy then slides to amount, Martinez panic rolls to his back, Paddy immediately gets hooks and starts dropping punches, to eventually get Martinez to rollover so he could sink in the RNC. 

Fight 2 Pimblett vs Decky Dalton (March 20th 2020)

Right away in this fight Paddy tries finding his range with a front kick, Dalton catches Paddy with a hook, then throws out a leg kick. Paddy is trying to move forward and find his range still, he’s checking leg kicks but leaving his hands down EVERY time. Again he is closing too much range, he isn’t understanding (yet) how long his reach is. Paddy then keeps at a good range, and counters Dalton in with a check hook and right straight, looks to land at least 1 if not both. Dalton throws a hook in counter but Paddy is out of range, Dalton throws a body kick and slips, Paddy swarms Dalton looking to capitalize, almost immediately getting his back. 

From this point, Paddy controls Daltons back very dominant for a few minutes, rains ground and pound while maintaining position, finishes the fight by TKO.

Pros: 

Incredible back take ability, has many different setups

Flourishes when a scramble ensues, Paddy thrives during the chaos of a fight

Kicks and knees compliment his style well 

Believes in position before submission

Extremely busy ground and pound


Cons: 

Range control

Backs up in a straight line

Hands down way too often for his level of striking

Seems like he’s “waking up” the first few minutes of each fight, the second a scramble happens a different Paddy comes out. 



Conclusion: Call me crazy, I think Paddy is a top 10 fighter in the next 2 years. His ground game is insane and his control is something amateurs could learn from. I love that he controls position before going for submissions and that he’s causing damage while on top. 

Whenever a scramble happens, chaos happens during a Pimblett fight. His striking needs work obviously, however I do think he’s been working in it, he may just need a better boxing coach. I like his kicks a lot and I think if he utilized thoughts to trust his range he will do better. Whenever he’s just trying to box he constantly ends up too close in range. If Paddy can learn range control, he is going to be a very difficult fighter to beat. 



Ceiling: Top 10, if he controls his range. This is key.

So the general idea is instead of the typical 50k/50k type contracts we have now, the fighters all get a set “tiered” contract (with ppv points and other bonuses offered to the higher tier contracts) plus an additional win bonus dependent on the “prestige” of the match. Oh and these win bonuses are set amounts like the 50k performance bonuses.

So if you win a title fight you get a set amount of “bonus” money, same as main event, co-main, main card fight, ppv fight, etc.

The idea is to have fair contracts, but still heavily incentivise winning and “prize fighting”. These win bonuses can even be used by the promotion for marketing such as saying there’s $1mill up for grabs in next ufc ppv main event or whatever.

Now I know there’s much bigger issues when it comes to fighter pay and this all works in an ideal world where promotions don’t screw over fighters by lowballing them in the first place (unlikely I know)... but was still something I thought would be cool to implement.",Cool way to increase fighter pay,23,1

However there is one name that I have noticed seems to be disregarded from this conversation who should be given a lot of credit for his accomplishments.

  
Randy Couture .

Randy was an absolute nightmare during his era, and considering he was a natural 205 lber, and didnt take all this time off to bulk up, like other people who go up in weight. I think he definitely deserves a spot in the Heavyweight GOAT top 5.

2. Pulling your arm back at contact. You need to punch through the target to get the knockout.  


3. Leaning over pivoting. Leaning on your cross will leave you off balance, less power and not able to throw your next punch.  


PROPER CROSS

\-Weight slightly back  
\-Dig your back foot into the ground  
\-Pivot your hips to your target  
\-Release your Cross arm Straight  
\-Turn your Fist over at contact, facing your thumb to the ground.  
\-Punch through your target.  
\-Bring you hip back allowing your arm to come back (not the other way around)

The winner of the round is scored 10 points. I get that. The loser will receive a 9 if its close, an 8 if they were overwhelmed or a “rare” 7 if the completely sucked. 

My question is what is a 6 and lower? If a fighter scores a 7 it means they fought like doggy doo-doo. How bad do they have to be to get a 6 or even worse...a 5?!

If the UFC brand refuses to reward fighters with a score of no less than 7, then why is it called a “10 Point Scoring System” and not a “4 Point Scoring System” if they decide not to score a fighter with “1-6” points.",I’m being completely honest when I say I have no idea how the UFC judges score a fight...can somebody help?,26,1

He got his name ""Funky"" and success in wrestling being unorthodox and that was his chosen sport. Hes going to come out super awkward, not behave at all like a boxer.

Despite his best efforts, Dustin knows he's down on the scorecards and is going to need a big 5th round. He looks across the ring and Conor McGregor is 100% locked in, focused, and got that look in his eyes. He needs something to give him an edge in this fifth and final round. 

Couldn't he attempt to distract Conor by making out with Mike Brown in between the round? Even in a tense situation and Conor's known mental fortitude, that would have to be a distraction, right? I mean, besides the element of surprise, Dustin is a pretty good looking dude. If Dustin and Mike had practiced beforehand and it's an especially passionate kiss, even the most heterosexual among us will admit that's a pretty hot scene. When the new round begins and Dustin gets up from the stool, wipes his lips off, and acts like nothing happened, no one is going to be able to just stop thinking about it. Conor's focus is going to be broken and that's the type of advantage that has huge implications at the elite level.

Are there any rules against this? How would the UFC react? Would Joe Rogan talk and the commentary team about the technique Dustin used?

Would love to hear your guys' thoughts on this and if you think it would be viable.",Could a fighter and his coach start kissing between rounds to distract his opponent?,12,1

""Well this is me"" gestured Mike to his hotel room across the hall. It was much smaller than Joe's. They locked eyes, it tasted only a moment; it lasted for an eternity.

""Hey uhhh Mike"" stammered Joe uncharacteristically ""You want to uh.. come in and do some Alpha Brain™""

""Sure I'll take some *Alpha Brain*"", Mike knew what *that* meant, as it had so many times before.

Soon, clothes littered Joe Rogan's oversized Vegas hotel suite: Mike's Tapout undershirt atop of Rogan's XXS Black snap-up with an XXL collar. The action was hot and heavy, then Joe landed a hard leg kick to the body, and fel on top, explaining that Eddie Bravo called this position the ""Ultra Dank Vaporized Jet Fuel"". Mike called it ""Doggystyle"". 

""Iron rod-esque is your cock in my ass, Joe"" yelled Mike Goldberg.

""Yeah I'm such a *physical specimen*"" Grunted Joe ""I've been hitting the Primal Kettlebells™ hard, only at ONNIT (that's O-N-N-I-T)""

""Correct Joe, you are the Michael Jordan of pounding my butt""

Before long, Joe was in ecstasy yelling incoherent nonsense and speaking in tongues. It sounded like a part of his standup special, but better paced.

""Ah speakin' the Port-tu-ge-se"" said Mike to himself knowingly. Or it could have been Japanese. Mike was never sure.

They laid down spent, Joe's bald head nestling into Mike's gelled tips. This beautiful moment couldn't last forever, could it? ""Is it all over?"" Mike Goldberg quietly and monotonically yelled at Joe. 

""Not when you're with me"" replied Rogan. They held each other in 50-50 guard as they drifted off to sleep. The last thing Mike heard before blissful unconsciousness was. . .

""Hey Mike, you ever tried DMT?""","In honor of r/MMA's special day, I present my Joe Rogan x Mike Goldberg erotica",8,1

* place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
* write a haiku
* draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

Wandy, Cro Cop, and Fedor were all losing to guys in the US that they did/would have destroyed in Japan. What’s everyone’s opinions on why this is? I’ve heard a few answers to it 

- different rule sets between PRIDE and MMA organizations in the US (eg no soccer kicks)
- transition from the ring to the cage 
- PRIDE athletes were just naturally aging out and would’ve started losing anyway
- More stringent PED testing in the US 
- many of their wins in Japan were “fixed” 
- some combination of all of these factors

Anyways is the consensus on this sub still that 5 months after the Darren Till fight Woodley just completely fell off a cliff and was past his prime? By saying that does it mean Usman wouldn’t of beat Woodley 5 months earlier at the time when Woodley was seemingly about to pass GSP in the goat conversation? Me personally that seems very hard to believe especially when you go back and watch his fights vs Rory and Jake Shields. Also Woodley was in goat talks after stuffing takedowns against Maia and fighting WB to a draw and arguably losing the rematch. Knowing that and then looking at Usman’s resume it would seem he’s not getting the same credit that Woodley got. Anyways any updates on what the current thoughts are on this would be much appreciated.,Tyron Woodley past his prime or now fighting better competition?,57,1

Heigh: 5ft 8inches

Assuming none of the fights fall apart, this will be Kamaru Usman's third time headlining such a card.

UFC 261 - Vs. Masvidal 2, other two title fights will be Rose vs. Zhang and Shevchenko vs. Andrade

UFC 251 - Vs. Masvidal 1, other two title fights were Volkanovski vs. Holloway 2 and Yan vs. Aldo

UFC 245 - Vs. Covington, other two title fights were Nunes vs. GDR 2 and Holloway vs. Volkanovski 1

UFC 205 - McGregor vs. Alvarez, Woodley vs. Thompson 1, Joanna vs. Karolina

UFC 217 - Bisping vs. GSP, Garbrandt vs. Dillashaw 1, Rose vs. Joanna 1

Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it says a lot about the UFC's lack of faith in Usman as a draw when the majority of his title fights are in these stacked cards.

Recently I've been looking into getting myself and my kids into something. Was looking at BJJ specifically, but not 100% yet (will probably try it out anyways). Just curious if anyone has any other suggestions or was in a similar situation to me.

Little background: Was a boxer for years until I had my first son. Continued to hit the bag for fun, but stopped competing. I LOVE standup and any type of combat sports. I completely regret not doing wrestling back in HS because of the stupid ass stigma about ""men touching men"" that kids in school would say. Both my kids also like to train and workout, but we really only have been doing some boxing and muay thai at home, because that's really all I can show them.

My question: Has anyone come from loving a standup style to enjoying a ground art? I'm a little worried that I'll get bored, and might be better off with something else, BUT I really enjoy working towards some type of progression. A belt system honestly seems really cool and something to constantly work towards. More importantly, I'm hoping it will keep the attention of my two boys (4 and 8). Any recommendations that I might be overlooking?",Question on different Arts with belt progression,15,1

I was ask to fight by a seasoned fighter today and I jokingly told him: yes but I'm not the best fighter thought. He then proceeded to kind of ignore me during the rest of the session and I didnt have enough courage to get into the ring with him. 

Later, I spar with my partner before an audience of seasoned fighters and I took many hit to the head. For some reason I wasnt able to protect myself well and she was using different combos on me. I felt ad if I was her beating bag and it just sucks. I need to get better and I think my mindset is all off. 

When I was younger I beat up a girl at the gym, I was hitting her in the face while she was standing before a brick wall. I gave her a concussion. That girl was my personal bully for 3 years before I decided I had enough.

That being said, there are of course plenty of situation that would warrant an interim title, or a champ being stripped, so here's my suggestion:

1. If a title cannot be defended within 8 months, an interim title is created.

2. If a title cannot be defended within 16 months, the champion is stripped.

3. If the champion refuses to defend against all of the top 3, they are stripped. (if the UFC wants them to defend against number 4 or 5 for whatever, that's fine, I'm talking about a top contender who's deserving of the match but being ducked by the champ, a la GDR). 

4. A failed drug test leads to being immediately stripped. 

5. If a champion loses a fight by DQ, the title does not change hands and is vacated.

I think this clears up any situation I can think of, but is there anything you'd do differently, or anything I've missed?","The UFC should codify hard rules for interim titles, and stripping champions",22,1

Big fan of the show, but loosing slight interest. I understand that MK works for a few company’s, and from that alone have to cover those companies content. Prior to Showtime and Bellator deal, notice that MK literally shit on Bellator for being a subpar product to the UFC?

Sure Bellator has some decent stuff... but covering what they want is long gone now. Unfortunately, MK is compromised by Showtime boxing and Bellator. Yes Luke and Brian have family’s to support and I totally get that.. but are we getting true opinions on Showtime Boxing and Bellator? I hate how Bellator is now being sold to us now. The only true opinions we get now is on the UFC... the company that they do not work for.

I believe they didn't want two thai fighters competing for a kickboxing title since Rodtang was pushed as the number 1 contender.

But despite this I think a super fight between Superlek and Rodtang is bound to happen whether it's in muay thai or kickboxing. I believe another reason why they screwed Superlek was because he has the style to beat Rodtang super fan friendly style. His style is so easy to promote to casual fans and derailing that would be bad for business.

But when they eventually make the fight happen in whatever rule set who do you think wins?

I believe the right kick of Superlek will defeat Rodtang.",Superlek vs Rodtang,21,1

In fairness to Aljo Yan was beating the crap out of him and a finish was coming. He was also gassed.

But Ben Askren literally entered the shadow realm and came back quicker than Aljo. Or so it seemed. 

Does anyone have unedited video of Ben Askren's recovery from the flying knee KO. Maybe there is crowd footage of him. I wanna see both fighter recover side by side. To me at first I thought Aljo was legit hurt which was true but seeing how other recovered from much more brutal knees it made me think that he was hurt but sold it so it looked like he couldn't continue.

Who do you people think are the greatest coaches in mma history? Either by consistently producing championship level talent or by their unique impact on the sport (or whatever other metric). 
I think my top three in no particular order:

Greg Jackson
Coached Jon Jones, Condit, Holly Holm and Rashad Evans during their peak runs. Seemed to have an cool system of oblique kicks and movement that was cool at the time. Not really as relevant nowadays.

Trevor Whitmore
Coaches Rose, Gaethje and Usman. /mma loves this guy right now. Really good at turning grapplers into mobile strikers with good hands.

Rafael Cordeiro

Was a beast himself and helped make murderers like Wanderlei, Vitor, Anderson Silva and Jose Aldo.

[Ariel &amp; Till Break Down The Schmo Beef](https://youtu.be/9CwP8DKrPIc)

[The Schmos Response](https://youtu.be/1b4q4vrNsf8)

There’s a lot of overlap in the stories so let’s break down the similarity to see if we can find out what actually happened.

I think the one thing we can say defo happened was Ariel approaching The Schmo since they both talk about that moment in near enough the exact same way.

This is where Ariel goes over to The Schmo to give him the email address of MMAfighting to try help job pick up a position there.

In The Schmos version of events he says “he ambushes me and says in this degrading way take out your phone and write this email address down that I never even asked for”

Ok well sure he didn’t ask for it but he said he gave Ariel his elevator pitch about trying to move up in the industry so I’m guna go out on a limb here and say Ariel was tying to do him a favour by giving him the email address. Ariel 100% didn’t need to try and help but he did anyway, I don’t see the problem, furthermore I don’t know how degrading it can be for Ariel Helwani, aka the biggest journalist in MMA to ask you to take out your phone and write down an email.

But both the men confirm this happened so let’s leave it as fact, I give this one to Ariel for trying to do a nice thing, honestly can’t see how he could possibly be in the wrong here. And the fact that The Schmo brings up that he “never even asked for (the email)” is pretty messed up, like you gave the guy your pitch and he comes at you with the email, maybe you didn’t explicitly *ask* for it but the guy is clearly trying to help.

Next the fake email address... this one is much harder to break apart. Very easily Ariel could have given a fake email to someone he thought he might not see again. On the flip it’s an email, Ariel has a pretty hard to spell name, obviously I don’t know the specifics but this could easily be a misunderstanding. If The Schmo could clarify exactly how he KNEW it was fake, as opposed to just maybe him taking it down wrong that might help.

This one has conflicting stories on each side tho. Ariel says The Schmo couldn’t produce the proof of this fake email, The Schmo says he showed it to Ariel and he accepted it was his fault. So show us the email then, easy fix. Let’s wait and see with that one.

Lastly The Schmo says the only reason he called him out was to raise money for charity.

Ariel says The Schmo called him out because he has something against him due to these previous interactions.

I think it’s safe to say that The Schmo clearly does have something against Ariel because of those interactions and this wasn’t *just* about the charity money, since he literally goes through the reasons as to why he has an issue with Ariel but then finishes by saying the issue has nothing to do with the callout... come on son.

Honestly if we can get to the root of this fake email thing we can probably figure out whose mostly telling the truth here but that will come down to one of the sides showing us some proof.

Apart from that pretty interesting insight into two big MMA personalities, I would 100% buy the PPV Dana make it happen.",Breaking Down The Schmo vs Ariel Beef,86,1

For part of this project, I need to hear from the product users (that's **you**, fighters) about what changes they see fit.

I subscribed to fight pass and in the background while working from home I've watched almost every single UFC main card in history.  It was great.  I loved it watching it go from the crazy Iowa freak show in the 90s to the modern version we know today.

I have never seen a fighter as precise as him. He dismantled an opponent that was bigger, had more stamina, and faster than him. He didn't flinch when countering, he just dodged and immediately countered. His takedowns and trips were also impressive. Altogether this guy was composed and savage the entire fight and it was really cool seeing him rarely flinch and just throw a cold counter at whatever Sterling had. He reminds me of more technical Fedor.

I guarantee you would either (A) be super happy and retire, or (B) try to win the GOLD next time.  But not Randy, he's not like you and me and other mere mortals.  Randy decides it's time to SWITCH to another sport, not something completely new like tennis, but different enough that he can GET EXCITED again about being an elite athlete.  And that's how Randy ""The Natural"" Couture became the first person EVER to win a UFC belt AFTER the age 40 -- but you probably already knew that part of the story.

He has a business.  He has a life outside of that little 5 second spectacle.

Insecure people don’t understand how he works because they imagine that level of failure being placed on themselves, and they can’t deal with it.  Truth is, there’s nothing embarrassing about being KO’d by another elite level fighter, no matter how fast.  Ben understands this.  He’s an elite competitor.  He knows the risks and the rewards.

He is of course following the laws imposed on his gym. This is his neighbor harassing him — according to Firas that is.


I train in the Bay Area. We watched Caio terras gym get shut down for operating secretly last year. Another local bjj gym was just shut down by the city govt because they had too many teachers in the room at one time (this is the second hand story I heard from my coach).

I decided to go to the doctors to get my headache I got after sparring checked out. I’m an amateur boxer inspiring to become world champion. Hence I want to prolong my career and not ruin it and become brain dead at 20 years old. I didn’t get knocked out or tko’d. I completely my entire training session fine and was aware of the headache. When it didn’t go away next morning I decided to go get it checked and turns out I have a mild concussion and no serious symptoms thankfully. I don’t want to stop training though. I will stop sparring for a month however and then slowly get back into it. But I don’t want to stop my overall training as I have worked so hard to get to where I am. I am deciding to stop Skipping for 4 weeks and replace it with swimming. I have also deciding to replace my runs with the exercise bike at my gym for 2 weeks. I also have decided to replace my stair runs with the stair walking machine at gym for 2 weeks.  
I want to ask for people opinions and advise on my decisions and also some advise on weather I should train on the heavy bag, double end bag still and at what intensity? And stuff I should be looking out for.

I think most people would agree that the top 10 has to include: Jones, GSP, Khabib, Aldo, Silva, Stipe, Fedor, Cormier, and DJ ... then maybe Cruz, Hughes, or Nunes. But if you compare their resumes to Poirier, I think DP has beaten far better fighters, and I think he could even be greater than DJ despite never being Champ.  
Holloway, Conor, Gaethje, Alvarez, Pettis ... That is arguably as good of competition as anyone has ever had ... and Poirier finished every one of them except for Max — but was dominant against him and was mostly dominant in almost every fight.

So, if he faced that level of competition, and did that well against them ... doesn’t he have to be at least Top 10 all time?  
Again, although I do like having this discussion, I’m really looking to give Dustin the credit he deserves because I still feel like he is possibly the most underrated Fighter ever, except for *maybe* José Aldo.

&amp;#x200B;

Alexander Romanov vs. Juan Espino

RESULT: Alexander Romanov defeats Juan Espino via split technical decision (fight stopped at 1:05 in 3rd round due to accidental illegal knee by Espino)

Alexander Romanov: #15 Aleksei Oleinik

In what I greatly anticipated as a high level heavyweight grappling bout, we saw two rounds of some great back and forth between Romanov, and Espino. Romanov is one of the strongest heavyweights in the UFC, and his throwing technique is top tier. Despite the disappointing finish to the fight, Romanov deserves a shot at the rankings. Russia's Aleksei Oleinik is coming off of two straight TKO losses, and perhaps a fellow grappler is the best next step for the Boa Constrictor. Oleinik-Romanov is a terrific fight on paper, and one that makes plenty of sense for both fighters.

&amp;#x200B;

Abdul Razak Alhassan vs Jacob Malkoun

RESULT: Jacob Malkoun defeats Abdul Razak Alhassan via unanimous decision

Jacob Malkoun: Tom Breese

Jacob Malkoun bounces back from his devastating loss to Phil Hawes in October, with a wrestling clinic against judo black belt Abdul Razak Alhassan. Malkoun dominated the fight for all three rounds, landing several takedowns, and neutralizing a powerful, yet heavily flawed striking game of Alhassan. Jacob Malkoun's wrestling is legit, and maybe he could be given a really good opponent to compliment his recent victory. Tom Breese has had some solid success at middleweight, after spending his career as a welterweight, Breese is 2-2 at 185, with both wins coming by TKO. Breese's last bout was a submission loss to Omari Akhmedov, so this fight makes a good amount of sense.

&amp;#x200B;

Andrei Arlovski vs Chase Sherman

RESULT: Andrei Arlovski defeats Chase Sherman via unanimous decision

Andrei Arlovski: Sergey Spivak

Andrei Arlovski's veteran savvy showed against Chase Sherman, and not only that, but Arlovski did it on 10 days short notice. The legend of Andrei Arlovski is not dead yet, and with two of his last three wins coming against solid opponents, perhaps he should get a bout with Sergey Spivak, as both fighters are now on the fringe of potential rankings. Sergey Spivak is 2-0 since his loss to Marcin Tybura, who is currently ranked. Like fellow Moldovan, Alexander Romanov, Sergey Spivak is a talented submission grappler, who has become one of the best prospects thanks to his skill set. A grappler vs striker matchup for Arlovski and Spivak is a great change of pace for these two talented heavyweights.

&amp;#x200B;

Robert Whittaker vs Kelvin Gastelum

RESULT: Robert Whittaker defeats Kelvin Gastelum via unanimous decision

Robert Whittaker: Israel Adesanya

It was 100% clear that Robert Whittaker was getting a title shot after beating Jared Cannonier. It is now 2,000,000% clear after tonight's masterful performance by Bobby Knuckles. Whittaker is now 3-0 since his loss to Israel Adesanya, the third UFC fighter to do so after losing to Stylebender (Marvin Vettori, &amp; Derek Brunson being the others). Robert Whittaker's clean sweep of Kelvin Gastelum proves that he is the best middleweight in the world outside of Israel Adesanya. Sorry Marvin Vettori, it looks like a fight with Costa, Cannonier, or Brunson is in your near future.

&amp;#x200B;

Kelvin Gastelum: Paulo Costa, Khamzat Chimaev, or Kevin Holland?

Kelvin Gastelum deserves a ton of props for stepping up to face Robert Whittaker. I knew that if Gastelum lost, he wouldn't get KO'd, just based off of his toughness alone. It's a loss, but not a bad one. With just about everybody above Gastelum busy for the near future, there's a few realistic options: Paulo Costa, the #2 contender at 185, was originally going to face Robert Whittaker, but pulled out a month prior, and Kelvin Gastelum was the one who filled in for him. Costa-Gastelum is a really nice looking fight on paper, and it makes a decent amount of sense. Then there's the phenomenon known as Khamzat Chimaev, who has been inactive due to a nasty run with COVID-19. With everything seemingly cleared up, Chimaev is targeting a return in the late summer, and if he wants to fight at 185, then Gastelum in a main event makes plenty of sense. Then there's Big Mouth. Kevin Holland, who is the first fighter with two main events in 2021, will undeniably be working on his glaring takedown defense issues, which Gastelum, a former college wrestler, would undeniably attempt to exploit in a hypothetical matchup. Gastelum-Holland is yet another fight that makes plenty of sense to make.

&amp;#x200B;

Bonus Round: Jake Paul vs Ben Askren

RESULT: Jake Paul defeats Ben Askren in Round 1 via TKO

I'm a man. I can admit when I'm wrong. Jake Paul's boxing is continuing to improve, and in his first bout against a former professional fighter, Paul just proved about 95% of the MMA world wrong with his shocking first round TKO of Ben Askren. Jake Paul finished Ben Askren faster than both Nate Robinson, and AnEsonGib. I shit you not. You just read that right. Controversial? Yes. Do I care? Well, who really does? Here's some options I have for dreamcrusher, and expert troller, Jake Paul.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 1: Joe Fournier (9-0, 9 KO/TKO)

This is the least popular option I have for Paul, Joe Fournier fought on the same card tonight, defeating reggae ton artist Reykon, with a retirement after two rounds. While Fournier's record looks good, his opponents aren't very remarkable. Reykon is the only opponent of his with a wikipedia page. Fournier isn't a very commercially rewarding fight for Paul, but he can help Jake take the next step in his boxing career.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 2: Floyd Mayweather (50-0, 27 KO/TKO)

I know how ridiculous I sound, and I know how ridiculous the Triller boxing craze is, but if there's money to be made, then Floyd Mayweather should fight Jake Paul instead of Logan Paul. With all due respect to Logan, I think that the big reason his fight with Floyd was scrapped, is because Logan still needs to show SOMETHING. Logan is 0-1-1, and a fight with Floyd has ZERO appeal. Look, I don't like celebrities boxing against legitimate legends/stars, but I'm talking as a businessman trying to make money, and Jake-Floyd is a money maker.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 3: Georges St. Pierre (26-2 in MMA, with 8 KO/TKO wins)

The fantasy matchup of Khabib-GSP is never going to happen, so why not get Georges St. Pierre a lucrative boxing match with Paul for sometime this year. GSP was always a good striker in MMA, and even though he has been inactive since 2017, the Canadian superstar has stayed in good shape in retirement. 

&amp;#x200B;

Option 4: Dillon Danis (2-0 in MMA, both wins by submission)

The longtime online rival of Jake Paul, Dillon Danis was the original option for Jake Paul after his win over Nate Robinson, but time constraints caused this fight to be sidelined for Askren. With a recent tweet from Dillon Danis, showing eagerness in fighting Paul, maybe the ""bad blood"" can be settled once and for all.

&amp;#x200B;

Option 5: Conor McGregor (0-1 Boxing Record, 22-5 MMA Record, 19 KO/TKO wins)

The question being: What are the biggest MMA fights you can make **right now**?

**For the sake of this discussion:**

* retired fighters can ***not*** be unretired (including but not limited to GSP, Khabib, 3C)
* no cross-promotion fights (I know you were eager to book CM Punk vs. MVP)
* catchweight fights are possible, but for added realism the maximum difference should be 1 weight class

**But what does ""biggest fight"" even mean?**

Glad you asked! You are more than welcome to book multiple ""biggest fights"" and state what makes them big.

Examples:

* Biggest fight from a commercial perspective (e.g. Conor vs. Masvidal)
* Biggest fight from a competitive perspective (e.g. Jones vs. Ngannou)
* Biggest fight from a meme perspective (e.g. Perry vs. Till)
* Biggest fight from a Just Bleed perspective (e.g. Gaethje vs. Felder)

Feel like getting my thoughts and memories out. You can ignore this post. Just nostalgic ramblings.

This is an old school MMA fan from Canada that has barely watched any MMA in years so I have a very different perspective than most. 

Watching MMA on UFC fightpass is having this bizarre affect. I believe it is called emotional recall. Names, places, conversations on the Underground forum, are coming back to me. I am talking about 8, 15, 20 years ago and further! Even back when some people wrote NHB not MMA.

I remember!

Its actually spooky! Memory can be molded and corrupted with time. But I have the suspicion that my memories, for the most part are at least near the mark of truth.

I remember where I was watching UFC 6! I remember watching Oleg Taktarov at a bar/restaurant that closed a very long time ago. I checked and my memory of that place is correct, it isn't a false memory.

I remember watching Vitor charge forward against Vanderlei. At another bar downtown. I remember the food wasn't very good, chatting with a Brazilian at that bar. Smirking inside,  I know way more about all the fighters than he could possibly know. He was amped after Vitor won. I was disappointed since I expected a longer gruelling match with a bloody Vanderlei getting stopped after a long battle.

I had a subscription to Full Contact Fighter, I remember they printed my ""email to the editor"" about Women in MMA and possibly UFC. A real magazine/newspaper about MMA!

I remember my box full of MMA VHS tapes. Mostly bootlegs. But I had the real Vale Tudo tapes, Black Belt magazine advertised them. I miss having those real tapes even though I haven't had a VCR in ages.

I remember being on an online group formed after Canadian cable distributors pulled UFC off Pay Per View TV. I remember writing a real letter, and forcing myself despite seething in anger to write some polite words to those we thought had power to reconsider. And I know it isn't a false memory. SEG gave some merchandise to the group, we had a UFC predictions contest and I won a tshirt,  I think I was third place. I still own it! The original old school Ultimate Fighting Championship tshirt! It's probably the oldest thing I still own.

I remember SEG wanted people to give input to the first UFC videogame. Emailing the developer a few simple ideas. I remember playing the Sega Dreamcast version as Tsuyoshi Kohsaka and Bas Rutten. When Zuffa arrived I told someone online (Dana?) that videogames needs special attention. It will help develop a young fanbase.

I remember the old Underground forum. I spent way to much time looking though the posts. Until I went cold turkey and stopped many years ago.

I remember the period when Zuffa first came in. The very old Q&amp;A's on that forum with Dana White and I believe Lorenzo Fertitta popped in that forum at least once. 

I remember telling those in charge to go overseas. Go before another company fills the demand and gets the clout of the UFC brand. I told them Macau could be a spot for an event. I pushed Montreal as a good test run for the concept. I repeatedly told them the UFC brand has to be brought to other countries. 

I remember telling someone in power,  who it was I don't know. I was convinced in the financial potential of the UFC. On the sports gambling angle alone made it worth the risk. But I said it might take 100 years but it will be big one day. And the response was, I hope it doesn't take that long. 

I remember using one of the early online overseas sports book.  Betting on Jeremy Horn in his match against Takase. Such easy money when I found out how light Takase came in as.

And I remember telling whoever, that if I had millions I would buy out SEG and try to save the UFC. It was critical for modernizing martial arts. It wasn't about money, you could build something special under the UFC name. 

In the early years you could see the impact already on the faces of the fighters. When a fighter got a belt, you could see the value was astoundingly high even back then. Regular people don't care, but the fighters do. Only they know the struggles to get it.

On that forum, you could send private messages. I think I was one of the few who took advantage of it early on. It felt as if I was whispering in the ears of those in power. Back in the old days their were still few hardcore fans. Today the whispers would be deafening shouts from a crowd.

I remember the jokes! Most in the off topic section of the forum.

Asking Joe Rogan, ""What herbs and spices are you smoking today?"" Telling him, ""I saw your stand up act. That one part was hilarious... the part at the end when you received a check! Just enough for fries, burger and a cola!"" Someone chimed in about ""happy meal"" I said, ""If it's a happy meal, why is Joe crying?"" I remember trolling Joe, ""Say it ain't so Joe! So you like to get high. I got something that will help. With this good book you will get so high, that you will reach heaven!""

So many jokes! Asking Eddie Bravo a technical question. The set up to the joke went something like this...""I was having a debate with someone when we were camping in the Rockies. Large feet and leg strength with submissions. Eddie, does it impact the success rate? Say a beast of a man charged out of the woods, with red eyes burning in wild anger. He tackles me, his foot is right their. Should I go for the foot submission against someone so tall and strong?"" Can't remember what he said, something along the lines of go for it. So I answered, ""You want me use submitions on a big foot? A Bigfoot! Really Eddie! What are you smoking?! Using leglocks on a Sasquatch!?! ""

I remember another joke, someone responded that he spit out his drink. It goes something like this. In the dark woods I meet bigfoot and take him down, rolling on the ground. I grab his leg. Look up at his face and see him looking down at me in a weird way. Look to my right, see his leg. Look to my left, see another leg. Think to myself, what do I have in my hands then?! NOOOOOOOO!!!

It's ridiculous that I still remember anything! I'm thinking that this must be false memories. I thought that my brain would wipe away these memories a decade ago. How is it possible?

I remember the serious dialogue also.

The talk of women getting into the UFC. I thought it would soften the look of MMA in the public's eyes. Thought it could help change political thought on MMA. Ironically I thought women could open the doors for MMA.

I remember telling someone that it was an untapped market. I pointed out that the Canadian women's soccer team has a loyal fanbase even back then. Back when a very young Cristine Sinclair was still not very well known. The UFC could supply the need for athletic female role models. Not enough professional female athletes at the time.

I remember having serious discussions online with Joe Rogan. I told him I understand your just a commentator and a fan. But I told him he is much more than that to the hardcore fans. I referred to him as an Ambassador of MMA. He was such a approachable guy online. Looking back it makes sense the success he is having now. 

I talked to him about getting women into the UFC. He told me those in Zuffa said, not yet. I gave him a few suggestions to at least build anticipation for those women with mild interest in MMA. I think he listened and acted on every suggestion I gave him. He talked to those in Zuffa about it. I think he helped spur the competitive drive of young women. They knew it was coming, a goal to reach for.

Everyone in MMA world were novices back in the old days. The average public, the mainstream media. In the early days of Zuffa's arrival, I would tell someone online, that was working for them that it's okay to make mistakes, it's okay to experiment. We are all still learning. It was still the stone age in MMA.

I remember the dialogue about the concept of the ""Hall of fame"". To soon then but it will be very important in the future. Years later I said that it is crucial for women. The lack of history in sports in comparison to men. Women want to know the past. The battles, the struggles, the heroes, the villains. People will be talking about the beginnings for decades later.

One problem about MMA in the past. It had so little history. No longer can I say this. Today mainstream news sites cover MMA, making notes of current events. Slowly but surely MMA has breached the wider world. You can be nostalgic now.

These are the words of a random person from Canada.  It feels like my mind is creating a lore of it's own.

See the results in the table at the end of the post. 

Hello everyone, at [mma-ds.com](https://www.mma-ds.com) we use AI and data science to analyse MMA. On our last [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/me2pqs/utilizing_deep_clustering_ai_to_investigate_mma/), we talked about the different strategic classes we found:

1. Striking heavy
2. Balanced Striker
3. Grappling willing
4. Balanced grappler
5. Grappling dominant

This week I dove deeper into the striking heavy class (fighters who only want to strike) to better understand the different tactics strikers use. To do this, I used an Unsupervised Learning technique called **Agglomerative Clustering**, which groups data into different clusters (groups of data where individuals should be similar to each other). In the future, I will write a more comprehensive article that’ll go into more detail about the techniques and thought process.

We considered that a striker’s tactics are characterized by two things: level of activity and what parts of his opponent’s body he is targeting. In this post, I will focus on the targeting aspect.

We started by collecting these stats from every round our heavy strikers have fought:

* head strikes attempted
* body strikes attempted
* leg strikes attempted

The reason we are only considering the attempted strikes is because we are interested in the fighter’s **intention**, not his success. We then converted these stats to percentages, so a data point could look like this:

**%Head -&gt;** 70% | **%Body -&gt;** 10% | **%Legs  -&gt;** 20%

We did this so we can separate activity and targeting completely (for now, we don’t care about how many strikes were thrown).

After applying the agglomerative clustering algorithm, we found these classes (the values presented are the medians of each class, so they don’t necessarily add to exactly 100%):

https://preview.redd.it/4d0lh39kztt61.png?width=792&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ba3ef002e3f8caa578f11869e0c2ca5c5678d98c

 

**I think the most interesting takeaway from this table is how prevalent the Head Hunter class is. At 60%, it’s more common than the other three combined.**

To all the commentators who’ve talked about how fighters head hunt too much: congrats, you were right. Well, at least it’s true that they do it very often. According to these findings, fighters will be very dismissive of the body and legs in  6 out of 10 rounds. Again, these stats are **by round**, so the same fighter can head hunt in a round and tree chop in another.

Previously I would say that about a Chael prediction as a bit of a joke, but I found it odd, that no, this time I felt it really meant Ben would probably lose. Curious, I decided to do a little half ass research to see just how accurate Chael has been.

I went to his channel, pulled up all the videos, and searched by “prediction”. Yeah I know, this wasn’t exactly a scientific study. Here are the results:

Till v Woodley	
P(Prediction): Monologues about how much he hates it when a sportscaster doesn't make a prediction…. Then doesn't make a prediction.	
R(Result): Woodley TKO

Pettis v Wonderboy	
P: Pettis (ballsy call imo)

R: Pettis KO

Blades v Willis	

P: Willis	
R: Blades UD

Khabib v Dustin	

P: Khabib 4 rd stoppage.	
R: Khabib 3rd round submission.

Felder v Barboza

P: Felder	
R: Felder SD

Cowboy v Conor	
P: Cowboy	
R: Conor TKO

Rose v Andrade	
P: Rose	

R: Rose SD

Usman v Masvidal

R: Usman UD

Max v Volkanovski	
P: Max	
R: Volkanovski SD

Aldo v Yan	
P: Aldo	

R: Yan TKO

Sean v Vera	

P: Sean	

R: Vera TKO

DC v Stipe	
P: Talks for a long time about it but I wasn't able to decode his prediction	
R: Stipe UD

JDS v Rozenstruik	
P: JDS	
R: Rozenstruik TKO

Khabib v Justin	

P: Leaning Khabib (I'll  give him that one)	

R: Khabib Technical Submission

Rob v Jared	

P: Rob	
R: Rob UD

RDA v Felder	
P: Felder	
R: RDA SD

Jacare v Holland	
P: Holland (another ballsy call imo)	
R: Holland KO

Tony v Charles	
P: Talked about it for a long time but I wasn't able to suss out the actual prediction.	

R: Charles UD

Figuiredo v Moreno	
P: Seems to predict Figuiredo?	
R: Majority Draw

Conor v Dustin

P: Conor via early stoppage	

R: Dustin via early stoppage

Jan v Izzy	
P: Izzy	

R: Jan UD

Yan v Sterling	
P: Sterling	

R: Sterling via DQ, I hate having to include this one

Nunes v Anderson	
P: Nunes	
R: Nunes

Holland v Brunson	
P: Holland, in the most non-commital vague way yet. His predictions get more vague and non-committal as time goes on.	
R: Brunson

Stipe v Francis	

P: Stipe, again vaguely	

R: Francis

Holland v Vettori	
P: Predicts there will be a fight.	
R: Vettori

Ben v Jake	
P: Ben	
R: Jake

Let's throw out the Moreno draw and all the ones where he didn't make a prediction. That leaves him at 10 for 22.

Conclusion. Flipping a coin is a slightly more accurate way to predict the result of an MMA fight.

Big thanks to everyone who put timestamps in the videos showing where the actual prediction was. I can listen to Chael talk about anything for 5 minutes, after that it's a bit hard to focus.

Sorry for the messy formatting. I put everything in a spreadsheet as I progressed and just thought I could copy and paste it into reddit. This isn't my day job. It came out a mess, so I tried to put in breaks where needed but reddit's formatting still came out all over the place.",Chael's Prediction Accuracy (or lack thereof),98,1

And we will all be excited. After all, he is considered one of the all-time MMA greats.

But here is the thing: At 44, Fedor is old. He also has not fought since two days before NYE 2019. Meanwhile, JDS turned 37 earlier this year, and Overeem is turning 41 mext month. Both were also each knocked out in their last fight.

I will admit that I have been majorly proven wrong about Bellator's 2021. Archuleta-Pettis and Lima-Amosov will be certified bangers, and so will be Pitbull-McKee, Velasquez-Kielholtz, and whatever Mousasi's and Vadim's next defenses will be when they each get dates. And that is not to mention the plethora of young future contenders Bellator is showcasing. But if Coker demotes these to the co-main in favor of the heavyweight dinosaurs, all the great work Bellator has done this year so far will be for nothing.

So yeah, I hope Fedor is not the main event when he returns. Especially not over an in-their-prime champion like his protege Vadim. If this happens, Vadim and company should consider taking their talents to Vegas, where DFW will reward them greatly with main events when (and not just if) they become champion (unless Conor is involved, though I believe he will be retired by then after fulfilling his trilogies with Poirier and Diaz).

Disclaimer: I was really hoping Askren would pull this off and I am **not** a Paul brothers fan.

People are seeing Askren smiling with his wife after the fight and are saying “lol easy fix.” Yeah man, it does feel good to get paid and he was probably laughing at what a joke the event was as a whole. Not because he just took a dive for a quick check.

I have a few problems with this theory. Yes the venue was an absolute embarrassment and was a joke to the highest degree. But here are my issues:

1) You are insulting a life long competitor, an Olympian, and former MMA world champion (who defended his belt numerous times) and essentially claiming that he would debase and disgrace himself and his legacy as a “fall guy.” As a fall guy for *Jake fucking Paul* none the less.

2) Saying he “just wanted to get out of there” is the dumbest shit I’ve heard anyone say. Why would he pop right back up like he did? Why not keep laying there? Why would he keep stumbling forward towards Jake if he wanted out? Do you really think Ben was scared of going the distance with Jake? The fight only had 22 minutes left (7 more 3 minute rounds + 1 minute). He has went longer than that *many* times. In fact when he talked to uncle Chael, he told him he was wanting to let him wear himself out in the first couple of rounds and batter him down when he was tired. You’re telling me he was so eager to get out of the ring he faked a fall 2 minutes into the first round, because he was scared of going the distance and making the fight drag out a little longer? To make it look *that* one sided? Especially when he’s done it 10+ other times with world class athletes?

3) I *hate* Jake Paul but if you looked at his technique versus the many rounds of footage we have on Askren, you knew where this was going from the beginning. You mean the piece of shit kid playing heel that’s taller, faster, younger, juiced, and weighs more *and* has been training at a real boxing gym for 3 years beat the guy with birthing hips and the slowest hands in MMA? *Insert shocked Pikachu face*

4) If you go back and watch the footage, when Askren stands back up, he actually fell backwards into the ropes before regaining his balance. And the ref asked him to *step forward and show him his gloves* and Askren couldn’t do it. **This is standard boxing protocol. This is not unique to this piece of shit venue.** Any other ref at any real event would’ve broken up this fight after a knock down and stumble like that.

Look, I hate Jake as much as the next guy, but I don’t hate Askren. You insult him as being a slimy little rat fall guy when you say he was just “looking for a check.” He’s a competitor and didn’t step out there to take a dive. He got rocked. They broke up the fight.","Saying the fight was a fix is an insult to Ben Askren, not the venue. This match wasn’t a fix.",28,1

A scheduled match between Jeremy Stephens and Drakkar Klose was cancelled Saturday due to an injury sustained by Klose during the pre-fight staredown. Yes, Stephens pushed Klose so hard that it gave him neurological impairment. Could he have been ""faking it""? How does that happen from a push? Let's take a look. ⠀

&amp;#x200B;

* Cervical whiplash is a term describing potential injury to the ligaments (sprain), tendons (strain), joints, and/or muscles of the neck caused by sudden acceleration-deceleration forces. Commonly associated with car accidents, it can result from any force that temporarily deforms the cervical spine in a way that exceeds normal physiologic limits. From the videos, it appears that the push indeed forced Klose's neck to go into flexion-extension, resulting in immediate symptoms. Nerve roots can also become irritated in the process, causing arm or hand numbness. Management for mild injury includes gentle range of motion exercises, as tolerated, followed by active return to normal activities. Symptoms usually improve within a month or two. However, more severe injuries can linger for longer. ⠀

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

*  Klose was also diagnosed with a concussion. It's a myth that direct head trauma is required to produce a concussion, as anything causing enough head acceleration can stress the brain. Symptoms such as headache, light sensitivity and nausea are therefore commonly associated with whiplash as well. The surprise nature of the push possibly made things worse as Klose was unable to brace for impact by activating his neck muscles beforehand. Also there is the possibility that recent dehydration for the weight cut and/or earlier brain trauma from sparring could have helped predispose to injury. The lesson here is that traumatic neck and head injuries often go hand-in-hand, and both must be evaluated in situations like this.

* Klose underwent CT scanning, presumably of both the head and neck, after reporting his symptoms. While concussion is a clinical diagnosis, a CT would look for acute life-threatening causes of post-trauma headache and nausea such as brain bleeds. A scan of the neck can also evaluate for fractures, instability, or severe nerve root compression. Fortunately, none of these severe findings were apparently present. 

⠀

* If symptoms such as hand numbness persist for weeks down the line, then an EMG/NCS (electromyography/nerve conduction study) may be useful. This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its location; whether that's along the nerve roots in the neck or further down in the brachial plexus (which is commonly seen in ""stinger"" injuries).",[OC] A brief medical explanation of Drakkar Klose's bizarre staredown injury,116,1

The worst example being that guy from Jake Paul's entourage taunting Tyron Woodley. 

I'm well aware that boxing is real and boxers are dangerous people. However I'm also aware that 99% of boxers would get clowned in a real fight, i.e. an MMA fight (or a street fight), against an MMA fighter. Hell, 99% of boxers would get clowned by grapplers as one-dimensional as Askren, even those with significantly less skills than Askren, in a real fight. 

It's such a strange spectacle to watch these boxer vs MMA fighter matches and see the bravado coming from the boxing side when everyone knows that they can only win this fight thanks to a highly restrictive rule set and a pair of giant bumpers they can use to protect both their heads and their hands. Everybody knows why MMA fighters are challenging boxers to their game and not the other way around, and yet there's this big charade going on.

Abstract: Viewers may be in for a long, tactical night, but full camp Masvidal plays wildcard yet again

Three champions. 8 collective title defenses. Zero losses. The UFC’s Welterweight and Womens’ Strawweight and Flyweight Champions have each defended their respective belts without losing them once. Fortunately for fans this Sauturday night, each of the challengers have not only been here before, but they have all won titles themselves. Jorge Masvidal did it for the BMF title vs. Nate Diaz shy of 18 months ago. Rose Namajunas seeks to reattain the belt she held for that same length of time – the belt she lost when Jessica Andrade slammed her 2 years ago. Andrade is stepping up to Flyweight to take on Valentina Shevchenko, who’s been undefeated in non-Amanda Nunes-bouts for over a decade. 
 
In 5 years Jorge “Gamebred” Masvidal hasn’t taken a decision victory, but the man has collected 5 finishes in that span of time – most notably recording a UFC-best 5-second knockout. He most recently lost to current champ Kamaru Usman in a decisive, yet relatively non-dangerous meeting last July. In the meantime, Usman defeated WW contender Gilbert Burns while Masvidal sat on the sidelines. Jorge’s BMF status, aggressive stand-up fight style, and 6-day-notice in their previous bout are amongst the biggest reasons for this unique opportunity to headline UFC 261 this weekend. As mentioned, Usman failed to prove dangerous enough to Masvidal in their previous matchup –  recording nearly 67% of grappling control during the 5 round fight[ufc stats](http://ufcstats.com/fight-details/d292243c6499b2fe) without any imminent threat of a finish, while Gamebred totes finishes in his last five victories.
 
Anderson “Spider” Silva’s dethroner Chris Weidman was 4-1 in title bouts during his near-2.5 year UFC Middlewieght Championship reign, but has been finished in four of his last six fights (winning the other two). A victory over veteran Uriah Hall (13-7 in UFC) would put him on a win streak after his victory over Omari Akhmedov last August. Anthony Smith challenged Jon “Bones” Jones for the Light Heavyweight Title in March of 2019 and is 2-2 since then.

The fighter  - the guy who initially got me interested was Nick Diaz. Mainly his training mentality. The fact that this guy was so mentally tough and did insane endurance training just seemed so cool to me.

&amp;#x200B;

The fight - well, I was already a fan of the sport. But I must admit, Diaz stepping in on short notice to take on Conor was the most invested I ever got into a fight.

How insane? Looking at total strikes attempted per round, there are about 10 outliers (extremely rare events) that correspond to the 0.3% of rounds with the most extreme values. From these 10, SEVEN are from Holloway. From those 7, 4 are from the SAME FIGHT (against Kattar). The other two are against Ortega (203) and Aldo (212), which has got to be the record.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Ngannou:** *Face*. 

&gt;I think he's just way too nice of a guy. Gentle giant vibes. Kind of like JDS, but to a lesser degree. I do think that he has potential to be a pretty decent heel, just due to how intimidating of a figure he is. Kane-like. It would depend on whether or not he could act mean without laughing.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Stipe:** *Face.*

&gt;This one's obvious. Basically everybody loves Stipe. I do think he could be a pretty decent heel if he wanted to be, though. He has this cold-blooded conviction within him that comes out when he talks about his doubters and how he doesn't care or worry about anything but winning.

&gt;Again, who the hell doesn't love Derrick Lewis? He's too funny and relatable to not be a face IMO. He could probably be a good heel if he played a creepy/nasty character. Think about his Ronda obsession and all his talks of shitting and his balls being hot. For now, Black Beast is a fan fave tho.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Curtis Blaydes:** *Heel.*

&gt;Ahh, we get out first bad guy. Blaydes isn't well-liked among most MMA fans. He doesn't have an incredibly exciting style for casuals and he has a menacing look and nickname to make a good heel. ""Razor"" Blaydes is cool enough to make a good heel persona. He's the big scary guy who cuts up all your favorite fighters.

&amp;#x200B;

* **Ciryl Gane:** *Heel*

&gt;This one is pretty weak, seeing as how Gane is a bit of a Neutral personality right now. BUT he did just come off a pretty ""boring"" performance for casuals and he did recently TKO the fan favorite JDS. Gane seems like a nice guy, but I just think he could stand to turn a little bit heel. I could see him being one of those heels that gives backhanded insults to the American crowds and doesn't understand why they don't like him.

- UFC 205: Tyron Woodley and Joanna defended their belts and Eddie Alvarez lost it to Conor;

- UFC 214: Woodley defended his belt, Cormier lost it to Jones (but then returned it after Jones popped for steroids) and Cyborg beat Tonya Evinger for the vacant WFW title;

- UFC 217: all three champions lost their titles;

I think there are a lot of misconceptions out there over how much fighters can make, or did make prior to the Reebok deal. 

It was always difficult to find public data on sponsor money back in the day. You'd hear rumblings about fighters being able to make approximately their show money in sponsor money, or sometimes more, but it was really hard to get actual figures. Then in 2014, this really interesting article was published about the company Dynamic Fasteners:

https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2014/01/so-what-is-a-dynamic-fastener-and-why-is-it-suddenly-all-over-ufc-broadcasts

If you were a fan at the time you remember their logo being featured prominently on loads of fighters on every card. It was really weird, as no one really knew what they did or why they sponsored so many fighters. The article gets into that stuff, but it also sheds a light on what they were spending:

""There’s also the fact that, per fighter, these sponsorships don’t cost him that much. For an average of about $1,500 each, Perz said, he can get his logo on several fighters at each event. Occasionally he spends more, as with his favorite fighter, Miesha Tate (in order, Perz’s top three favorite fighters are Tate, Jon Jones and “whoever’s fighting Ronda Rousey”). He paid Tate $6,500 for her fight with Rousey, he said, and also offered her a $10,000 bonus if she won – that’s how much he wants to see Rousey get beat.""

If you look back at where their logo was on fighters, you'll find it was usually on the ass which is the most expensive place to advertise on. So for $1500 they were able to get this space on pretty much any fighter they wanted that wasn't in the main or co-main event. For Miesha, they ended up only having to pay $6500 for this spot. Now Miesha had a few other sponsors on her kit for this one, but also keep in mind this was one of UFC's biggest PPV's ever (Weidman/Silva 2 was the main event and this one did over 1M buys, plus Tate and Rousey had done a season of TUF leading up to this). 

As a title challenger under the Reebok deal she would have received $30k guaranteed for this fight, just for comparison. 

While the top guys could undoubtedly make good money from sponsors, I think the reality is that for the vast majority of fighters that wasn't possible. So if this is what it was like in the UFC, I find it really hard to believe that Bellator fighters are making a lot off sponsors, as some people here often allege.",On Sponsorship Pay,58,1

Dont think any of them will drop the belt tomorrow, maybe Zhang Weili because she's facing a real technician in Rose. Usman I don't see losing to Jorge, he beat him before, he's had a camp dedicated to working him out, can't see it happening. And Valentina is style wise a poor matchup for Jessica on the feet.

Of the other champs, have to say that Figgy imo is the next guy to drop it. The way he fights is exciting, but also leaves him open imo. Nunes is facing Pena, which is a mismatch if ever I saw one, Aljo is out of for 6 to 8 months, outside of the UFC stripping him he's got that for the rest of the year. Volkanovski is also out till TUF is done. No Lightweight champ yet, Adesanya v Vettori is supposedly next, can't see him dropping it to Vettori, Jan I think wins against Glover but after that he's going to be getting on against younger guys, and Francis is Francis, young and here to stay.

Bellator has many Brazilians in its current roster, including four champions in five weight classes. Patricio Pitbull is as dominant as they come as the featherweight champion, and he is also the lightweight champion. Douglas Lima is considered the best welterweight outside the UFC. And let us not forget Cris Cyborg, the most intimidating woman in all MMA outside of Amanda Nunes.

And yet... not a single event in Brazil, which is basically the birthplace of MMA and has the sport's most rabid fans. And it is a shame, especially as this pandemic may have ended any hopes that it will happen. Bellator has gone to the UK, Ireland, Italy, and Israel multiple times; and it held France's first major MMA event. It even visited Japan two days before NYE 2019 as part of its collaboration with Rizin. So why? Why has there never been a Bellator event in Brazil?

This is false

Fury and Wilder were guaranteed 28 million each PLUS ppv and they only did 325k buys in the first fight. The second fight proceeded to do 850k buys. This was the biggest heavyweight fight in the USA in the last 10-15 years and it did 850k buys.


This is Jon Jones PPV history

UFC 235 - Jones vs Smith: 650,000

UFC 232 - Jones vs Gustafsson II: 700,000

UFC 214  - Jones vs Cormier II: 860,000

UFC 197 - Jones vs St Preux: 322,000

UFC 182 - Jones vs Cormier I: 800,000

UFC 172 - Jones vs Teixeira: 350,000

UFC 165 - Jones vs Gustafsson I: 310,000

UFC 159 - Jones vs Sonnen: 530,000

UFC 152 - Jones vs Belfort: 450,000

UFC 145 - Jones vs Evans: 700,000

UFC 140 - Jones vs Machida: 485,000

UFC 135 - Jones vs Rampage: 520,000

UFC 128 - Jones vs Shogun: 445,000

He has an average of nearly 550k PPV buys which is better than every boxer today not named Canelo yet Jon is paid worse than just about every PPV boxer out there today.

I came across [this video](https://youtu.be/uPbYcUMAep0) which kind of gives an explanation to my question from a scientific point of view, but I still have more questions. I tried to watch couple of MMA fights just to understand the appeal of it. During the fights, the fighters are going through major punishment on their bodies. I often read after some fights that the fighters are rushed to the hospital. This can't be a good effect on the fighter's health long term.

If a fight ends in a KO, that most likely means that the losing fighter could suffer a concussion. And concussions can lead to CTE. I'm quite a hypocrite because I watch professional wrestling, but there are stories leading to the matches, bigger then life characters. They do take a risk stepping into the ring even if the wrestling is choreographed.

But that the thing. MMA isn't choreographed. The strikes and kicks to the fighter's body and even on their head is very real. Obviously MMA fans knows that. So what's the appeal of MMA?",Why do you watch MMA?,100,1

For example,if you knock a fighter down and then pursue them with ground and pound until the ref calls it.-I would think it would ruled as a TKO,but did you ruin your chance of getting it ruled as a KO?What if you knocked the fighter down,but didn’t pursue the ground and pound-and the downed opponent was too damaged to get up and continue anyway. I assume that would be ruled as a KO instead of a TKO. It seems to be a gray area on whether to rule something as a KO or TKO,unless I’m missing something? Also,who actually deciphers the result?(is it the ref?or are they just responsible for stopping the fight?)",How do officials know whether to rule the result of a fight as a knockout or a technical knockout,33,1

Three title fights, and three finishes to cap off the first full capacity main event since UFC 248. I really got into MMA during the pandemic, and the last fight I watched with a full crowd when McGregor rematched Diaz in 2016. Here's to many more full capacity events as the world we know is slowly coming back before our eyes. Unfortunately, for the next two weeks, we will have to return to the cold confines of the UFC Apex, but then we are back for UFC 262 in Houston, featuring some super fun fights then. So, with that being said, here's some fights to make after an amazing night of fights.

&amp;#x200B;

SPEED ROUND

Danaa Batgerel: John Castenada

Brendan Allen: Ian Heinisch; the two were originally going to fight last November, but COVID protocols scrapped the fight. Sometime in late June, or UFC 264 on July 10th is a good time to make this bout happen.

Karl Roberson: Nassourdine Imavov; this depends on the severity of Roberson's apparent knee injury from the nasty heel hook by Allen. Imavov and Roberson are now both coming off of losses.

Dwight Grant: Khaos Williams; Not 100% sure about Grant's win over Sekulic. That being said, Grant could still use a good opponent like Khaos Williams

Randy Brown: Carlos Condit? Terrific fight for Randy Brown, getting a huge submission win in Round 1. 

Alex Oliveira: Alex Morono? Oliveira came out on the wrong side of this animosity filled bout. Morono is coming off a loss to Anthony Pettis, so this bout makes sense.

&amp;#x200B;

THE MAIN CARD

&amp;#x200B;

\#6 Anthony Smith vs. #13 Jimmy Crute

RESULT: Anthony Smith defeats Jimmy Crute after Round 1 via TKO (leg injury)

&amp;#x200B;

Anthony Smith: Johnny Walker or Reyes-Prochazka loser (potential main event)

Anthony Smith wins his 2nd consecutive fight since losing to Glover Teixeira, and Aleksander Rakic in 2020. Until the unfortunate leg injury from Crute, Smith was showcasing a very good jab that essentially dictated this fight. Since the rest of the division is relatively pretty busy, Smith could get a fight with Johnny Walker or the Reyes-Prochazka loser for a main event sometime later this year. Johnny Walker was originally going to fight Jimmy Crute tonight, but a nasty bicep injury cost him the opportunity to battle in Jacksonville. Since Johnny Walker just got a TKO win over Ryan Spann, he should get a 2nd chance to move up in the division. The next option for Smith is still a good one: The loser of Reyes-Prochazka, a main event that is going down next week. Either opponent is a great one for Smith, who is trying to dig his way back up the LHW latter.

&amp;#x200B;

Jimmy Crute: Nikita Krylov?

We can't really be certain with Crute at the moment. Crute just had an unfortunate ending for his first huge fight in the UFC, suffering a very nasty leg injury that seemed to deaden his leg in a really repulsive way. I'm not doctor, but I think that this leg injury can, and possibly will be very serious, so with that being said, it may be a year until we see the Australian again. A good opponent is Nikita Krylov, who is coming off a loss to Magomed Ankalaev last February. These two are dangerous submission artists, and a fight between them makes a ton of sense, but the landscape could be so much different by the time Crute returns.

&amp;#x200B;

\#9 Uriah Hall vs. #11 Chris Weidman

RESULT: Uriah Hall defeats Chris Weidman in Round 1 via TKO (leg injury)

Uriah Hall: Kelvin Gastelum?

This result was absolutely heartbreaking for everyone involved. Uriah Hall just gave his respects to Chris Weidman, and he told Joe Rogan in the post fight interview that he will give Chris Weidman an immediate rematch if, and when the All-American returns. This is obviously something that Uriah Hall can't help that happened, and I think that Hall more than deserves a fight with viable contender. Kelvin Gastelum fought just last week against Robert Whittaker, losing by a clean sweep UD. Gastelum-Hall is good fight for both sides, and striking wise, it's not a bad matchup. As for Chris Weidman, obvious thoughts and prayers for the former champ, and also obviously, it will be quite a while before we see him again. I, like everyone else is hoping for a full, and healthy recovery for Weidman, as he undergoes surgery soon.

&amp;#x200B;

(C) Valentina Shevchenko vs. #1 Jessica Andrade

RESULT: Valentina Shevchenko defeats Jessica Andrade in Round 2 via TKO (punches &amp; elbows)

Valentina Shevchenko: Winner of Joanne Calderwood-Lauren Murphy (sacrifice)

No one will beat Valentina Shevchenko at 125. Not ever. We are truly witnessing greatness, and the seemingly endless build up to Nunes-Shevchenko III. It's the most even fight to make for Bullet, but with Nunes dealing with some business in August against Julianna Pena, the obvious next fight is the winner of Lauren Murphy-Joanne Calderwood, which is essentially a title eliminator. Target this for the third or fourth quarter of 2021, then we'll talk about Nunes-Shevchenko III for 2022.

&amp;#x200B;

Jessica Andrade: ???

The result was pretty much exactly how we thought it would go, and with Jessica Andrade's history of changing weight, who knows where Andrade fights next. Assuming that she stays at 125, maybe Viviane Aruajo if she beats Katlyn Chookagian in May. There's really not many options at the moment for Andrade in the midst of her two main divisions.

&amp;#x200B;

(C) Zhang Weili vs. #1 Rose Namajunas

RESULT: Rose Namajunas defeats Zhang Weili in Round 1 via KO (head kick)

Rose Namajunas: Weili rematch, Joanna trilogy, or Xiaonan-Esparza winner, or Mackenzie Dern.

THUG ROSE! THUG ROSE! THUG ROSE! THUG ROSE! Rose Namajunas has become the first 2 time champion, and she did it by geniusly catching Zhang Weili with a massive head kick, doing what Joanna, nor anyone else was able to do in any UFC bout in Weili's career; beat her. There's all kinds of options for Namajunas after this win, and guys, I might need your help finding that option. Please give me your thoughts on who Rose Namajunas should fight next in the first defense of her 2nd reign as UFC Strawweight champion.

&amp;#x200B;

(C) Kamaru Usman vs. #4 Jorge Masvidal II

RESULT: Kamaru Usman defeats Jorge Masvidal in Round 2 via KO (punches)

Kamaru Usman: Colby Covington II

Kamaru Usman is the clear front runner for fighter of the year. An unstoppable force at welterweight, The Nigerian Nightmare is making your worst dreams become a grim, and absolutely mind boggling reality. Usman is a monster. He's the P4P best fighter in the world, and Usman will potentially hold that position for many years to come. I'm going to take back what I said after UFC 251, and just take the time to really process what the fuck just happened. This night has me absolutely shook up, for the good, and for the bad. Anyways, Kamaru's next opponent is more than obvious. It's time to run it back with Colby Covington, and while that fight is obviously a tremendous one, I think that Usman will finish Colby sooner. Kamaru just defied all logic, by slumping Masvidal, and eluding the Chael curse.

&amp;#x200B;

Jorge Masvidal: Winner of Edwards-Diaz

That's a tough one. The Usman-Masvidal rivalry has come to a wild, yet a demanding end. Usman and Masvidal will never fight again. It's obvious. If Jorge fights in the UFC again, then maybe he could get a BMF rematch with Nate Diaz if he beats Leon Edwards, or he could finally settle his long standing beef with Leon Edwards. Gamebred is only going to be in it for fun fights from now on, and like the Scarface films, the rise and fall of Gamebred began in chaos, and ended there too.

Wow. UFC 261 main card was as dramatic and definitive as any card in recent memory. I wondered after the Smith-Crute stoppage if Sean O'Malley might feel vindicated in his ""deadened nerve"" defense regarding the legitimacy of Marlon Chito Vera's leg injury TKO over him. Crute definitely was not fit to continue, though upon replay it doesn't appear that any serious damage occurred. Perhaps he might have injured his knee ligaments in his Bambi-like attempts to regain his footing, but fortunately the kick itself didn't appear to do any long-lasting damage. Not to downplay the severity of it, he was clearly not fit to continue. I actually believe his corner should've stopped the bout themselves instead of leaving it to the doctor.

And then that Weidman fight occurred... Oh My God. What was Weidman thinking?! That calf kicks were the least-well-kept secret ever regarding a return to form? He just booted the front of Hall's shin with reckless abandon. Wow. I'm surprised O'Malley's leg didn't break just from watching that. In all seriousness, hope Weidman heals properly and love the crowd support for him and Hall's trademark humanity in victory.

Anyways, enough of ripping on O'Malley (who I actually don't mind, even if Vera's ""discount McGregor"" diss wasn't entirely inaccurate. The 3 championship bouts were incredible. I really thought Andrade would give Valentina more trouble with her immense strength in the clinch. It just seemed that Shevchenko's technique with the upper body takedowns was too much. Upsetting her balance, the head and shoulder pressure...Certainly Valentina being a 125er didn't hurt either. I was surprised to see how little Andrade's famed strength mattered when they tied up. Good stoppage.

I'd initially predicted Zhang Weili's power and durability would make the difference in a close decision win over Rose, with Rose fading late vs Andrade in mind. Upon re-watching Zhang-Joanna this morning I changed my mind, seeing how Joanna was able to connect with long straight punches early and make Zhang miss with her 2-3-2 counter combinations. With Rose being just as quick and sharp as Joanna, and longer and harder hitting to boot, I flipped. But I did not expect that!! Seems like Zhang Weili pulled her leg away, expecting an inside low kick. DC's KO over Stipe and Anderson's first loss to Weidman come to mind here. It's not about some quantitative chin strength metric, it's about whether you have your feet under you when the blow lands.

And that main event!! I'd predicted an Usman decision win. Such a gamble, I know. Upon re-watching his win over Burns I noted how much more effective he was with those long straight shots, rather than the awkward overhand he attempted in the 2nd after he'd already had Burns hurt. Masvidal clearly lost the first round but seemed to be racking up attritive damage with the low kicks. Kamaru certainly has an impressive physique, but his legs are relatively skinny and I wondered what 5 rounds of those kicks might do.

Wouldn't matter one bit. Perfect straight right hand with Usman's full weight behind it, as Jorge was trying to throw a counter left hook. Jorge's head was completely perpendicular to the blow when it landed. No surprise it felled him, even with his legendary durability. Rivalry settled. Hope Wonderboy beats Burns and gets a shot at Usman before age becomes a factor in that matchup.

If you guys like my take on the fights, I'd greatly appreciate if you'd check out my Youtube channel where I do pre- and post-fight thoughts.

Instead of a more reasoned approach such as the one you see in your average boxing match, in which fighters ""fight from defense"". For instance: this difference was pretty dramatic when Ngannou was playing with Tyson, and Tyson was doing his ""peekaboo"" usual game - and, immediately afterwards, there was Ngannou's match with Stipe in which he was furiously raining hail maries on him.  
Or, other small example: kick defense. I don't quite remember when I've seen something like the ""elbow trick"" to defend from a kick (when you lower your elbow so as to intercept an incoming kick - which hurts like fuck - don't know the name of this thing).

We called him boring, so delivered one of the best fights I’ve ever seen. 
We doubted his finishing abilities so he KTFO out of two durable vets. He even gave a guy he dominated a rematch because he wasn’t satisfied and wanted the finished, and he delivered. 
We thought his interviews were cringe and he just copied quotes from guys like McGregor. Leading up to the fight he gave the interview explaining his transition from Marty to Kamaru which I found very inspiring and emotional. He delivered great unique quotes like “he’s the first guy I’m lapping” and his post fight interview showed a genuine and articulate side.

IMO he did something GSP never did, he took risks to prove his greatness. He wasn’t satisfied with just winning, he wants greatness, and he is achieving it without a doubt. GSP once said he wanted to be the Micheal Jordan of MMA, but he never understood winning alone wasn’t what made him.

Meanwhile, I'm sitting there just kind of stunned that people got their pitchforks for a guy (Sekulic) that threw fucking 10 strikes in the first two rounds.  Also sitting there laughing because DC and Rogan's inability to judge was clearly affecting what people thought.  DC said that takedown at the end of the first (10 seconds to go) should've won him the first round.  Shit is insanity.  But since Rogan and DC were sitting there saying he's up 2-0, yeah for sure, massive robbery.  Idiots.  All of you.  Sekulic probably did edge out that 2nd and the fight.  But it was by doing just barely more than Grant.  Aka just walking forward.  Only definitive round was the third.  There have been a lot of true robberies in this sport.  Don't make light of them by putting those first two rounds in with that mix

Not being able to accept that others could score a pretty close fight differently is honestly pretty similar to intolerance in general.  Not every fight has a 100% clear, rightful winner.  It's 3 rounds, 3 set of eyes...on a 10 point must system.  Literally 1 minute (or even 15-30 seconds) of someone else seeing it slightly different than you swings a close fight.  It doesn't make it a robbery.  Get a fucking hold of yourselves /r/mma.  It's literally every fucking weekend now

I kind of remember more of it starting with Song Yadong/Chito and it's just snowballed since.  No, that wasn't a 'robbery' either.  Stop.  B\*tches",Whining about 'robbery' over close decisions has gotten way out of hand,35,1

As well its a huge cash cow.

Personally i love it, fight at this level can be won by simply making 1 error. Love the fact fighters can try to redeem a loss or to impose their will a second time. Storylines are always a great buildup on rematches. 

A rematch is a clear cut way for opponents to take ( a second L) and be humble - as we saw with Masvidal. So cringey when a fighter gets lucky, so to say, lay down huge trash talk after, only to never accept a 2nd fight.

Falling body weight on the outside knee from the rear bodylock positions are dangerous! In this circumstance, a circular motion would have been safer, but hey - it's mma.

Brown is able to pull the one arm choke off because his choking elbow aligns well with the chin and the hand is hidden behind the shoulder, reinforced by his chin. Cowboy did a poor job defending here. You pull your choking elbow in the direction of the elbow while maintaining the orientation of the choke and that's how you finish with one arm.

After defeating Alex Oliveira by RNC in the first round at UFC 261, Randy Brown was asked about the bad blood between Alex and him. Instead of answering the question in the octagon, Brown said to go to his twitch where he would reveal all the details. I know r/mma was curious about it, but not all of the users were willing to go to these lengths to discover what he said. I, on the other hand, was willing to.

Randy Brown tells this story at [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1000971184](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1000971184), but one must skip to 23:00 to hear what he had to say.

I know some of you may not be comfortable, or not willing, to go and watch it so I will transcribe it here. The story is too long to clip on twitch which is why I must go to these lengths. But I will say that **this transcript was done by hand and may be lacking in some areas. I highly recommend go watching his explanation**

**Brown:** ""So honestly though, the beef was like this. It's not even a real beef, I think. Personally, the whole week I was good with dude. Soon as I go there \[Jacksonville\], guess who I saw? He was in the hotel, in the lobby, getting checked in. I went to the store, I got something to drink and I was coming back, me and my manager. I see the dude in the hallway and I walk up to him, tap him on the shoulder. Y'know, introduce myself. I say 'Hey.' There's a language barrier, he doesn't speak English, so. But the universal word for respect is Uos(?). So I say 'Uos, sir.' 🙏🏿 \[Brown did this gesture while speaking\]. I shook his hand, y'know. He \[Oliveira\] smiled ear to ear. I expected him, y'know he's a super happy guy. And that was it, y'know. All my interviews throughout the week, I spoke about how much I respected him. I'm actually a fan of the dude.""

**Brown's Companion:** ""You said that in your interviews.""

**Brown:** ""I am a hug fan of Cowboy Oliveira. Like, don't get it twisted, aight? I love the way that dude fights. It's insane! I've been watching him for a while. And... I just didn't get it. We're backstage now, y'know? I watched his interviews too. His interviews, he was super respectful. He said '*We're gonna beat the crap outta each other and get a drink after.'* I was like *'Yo, this gonna be lit. I'm gonna be fighting Cowboy this weekend, we gonna go crazy.'* I'm backstage, everything is good. Y'know what this dude got mad for? Guess what he got mad about?

**Brown's Companion:** ""Was it the Instagram post?""

**Brown:** ""If y'all go to my Instagram, [touchngo\_](https://www.instagram.com/touchngo_/). And.. This dude really. I guess it just got lost in translation. [I posted a video of a guy dancing saying *'This is gonna be me when Cowboy starts coming out.*](https://www.instagram.com/p/COBEBw_pfSQ/)*'* This is because he starts dancing \[When he walks out\]. Apparently he thought I was making fun of him, saying '*This is how Cowboy looks when he fights.'* Or y'know this whole thing on how he walks out and how he fights. **A\*\*\*\*nd y'know, fighters are sensitive. I told you that. As much as you want to think that fighters are these big macho, y'know whatever it is. These are some of the most sensitive motherfuckers in the world. I'm telling you, this is why we fight. We all got chips on our shoulders and a lot of people are upfront with the humbleness and the martial arts. No, everybody got a huge ego and are fragile as fuck.** So, in his mind cause of the language barrier, he thought that I was making fun of him. But I really wasn't. I was just making a joke saying '*This is gonna be me.'* So we're at the weigh-ins, backstage, and he was cool, which was weird to me. So I see him at the weigh-ins backstage and when I see him, he's standing right behind me. So I turn around, give him a fist bump. Again, same thing, he smiles and gives me a fist bump and we got up on the stage. So when he got up on the stage I expected him to come with the Ra Ra or stereotypical Cowboy. Smiling and like y'know, with that good energy. Goofy, y'know what I mean. But it wasn't that. It was more like, he was just talking saying something about two. Afterwards I heard, somebody translated what he was saying. He was saying how he's gonna break me in two. '*You're big but you're only one man and you talk too much and I'm going to break you tomorrow.'* Which is cool, alright, like this dude can really turn it on. Which is fine if you want to, y'know, get the crowd going. But the way it was, it was different. It wasn't like he was selling the fight. Y'know what I'm saying? So we got backstage. And I was like *'Listen, you keep that same energy.'* I don't know if I'm wrong for this, but I'm a human right? Just like anybody else. So I was just like '*If you want to act like this, this is how we gonna keep it.'* So I was backstage and I was trying to talk to him. As soon as we went back. He got in my face again and security had to pull us apart. So when security pulled us apart I was like '*Bro I'm about to fuck you up. You're doing a lot, this is  unnecessary. And I came to you respectful.'* And I was still confused why he was acting like an asshole. So now we're in the fighter's meeting again and this dude is mean mugging me back and forth. And I was like *'I don't know you bro. You don't speak English. I see you on TV. I just operate different. If you get to close to me, Imma...* [I can't let you get close to me, bro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GyG7c1Z3dZM&amp;ab_channel=born6ghst1). I just can't, I'm going to have to hit you cause I don't want you to hit me first. That's just how life works. And everybody came in between us again because he was getting to close to me. So I stood up and.. A bunch of bullshit. Rarara and everybody pull us apart. So now we fighting. I'm not going to touch gloves, it's personal. It's personal now. So after we fight, it's no '*Oh yeah good shit.'* Keep that same energy man. Get the fuck outta here bro.  Don't make me be the bad guy cause y'all don't know the story. Now I'm the bad guy, I'm the asshole. Trash with no class because I told him to fuck off. In that moment, fuck him. In that moment it was fuck you. Alright? I'm not fucking with you. I don't respect what you did and this this isn't '*We buried the hatchet, good fight🤝. I don't fuck with you.""* But we did end up burying the hatchet. Here's what happened, we we're backstage, I saw his manager. He speaks English and Portuguese. He came up to us, and my team, and we all just started talking. His manager was talking to my manager and we were talking about what happened. Turns out he thought that I was making fun off him \[Cowboy\]. So I say ""Tell him this is me. I'm gonna be dancing becuase when you come out, you're known to dance so I'm gonna dance with you. This is just how I dance."" And he felt bad and apologized and we were cool and we took a picture and we're cool now.""

It's blown up and I've heard multiple times how it's something Mcgregor wasn't aware of because it evolved into the sport during his absence. I find this absolutely ridiculous. I'm not an expert on it or know every detail about it's origin and use, but I don't see it the way it's being framed.
Go back and watch the Mcgregor/holloway fight for example. Max throws that shit like a dozen times just in the first round of the fight and it was clearly part of his fight strategy against Conor. That said, it obviously didn't have the impact and damage that Dustin's had, but it was still present and still part of an active game plan/strategy against Conor's style and stance. I just get annoyed seeing it taked about and framed as if dustin is the first to use it or how Conor had no idea about it (joe rogan specifically said this) because it was recently incorporated during his ""absence"".

If you can’t tell, I think it should, but I also can’t imagine a world in which judges could do this accurately. 

It’s pretty clear that a properly executed check is more damaging to the kicker than the checker, even when the leg isn’t visibly damaged, but most judges can barely manage scoring fights as it is, so to ask them to consider where exactly  where a kick landed and if the person getting kicked checked it, is probably just too much. I don’t think I could do it in real time, but I’m not sitting cage side, so they do have an advantage there.

Before 2018 he was a very average bottom-of-top-15 Middleweight. Then he decided to go to Light Heavyweight and:

- He hot a title shot after beating corpses of Rashad and Shogun and after comeback victory over Volkan;

- He actually had the chance to become a LHW champ when Jones suddenly decided to knee him in the head. He didn't took the chance but, as we know now, he totally could;

- From 2018 to 2020 he headlined 7 (!) cards in a row while still being a very average fighter. And in the last two cases he was elevated to a main event after the original main events fell through;

- And now he beat a dangerous prospect Jimmy Crute after one but precise leg kick that completely fucked his leg. And Ithink that it was definitely a lucky shot because Smith wasn't known for Barboza-level leg kicks before.

When I say Kamaru Usman is the best athlete in MMA, I mean he is the most well-rounded fighter in terms of physical qualities. He is:

* Long - He is 6'0 but has a reach of someone who is 6'4. Three inches above the average Welterweight.
* Slightly tall - One inch above the Welterweight average.
* Has power - KO'd Covington, Masvidal and Burns the latter with a jab.
* Is strong - No explanation is needed here. Shown in the Woodley fight.
* Is big for the division
* Has a solid chin and overall durability - Shown in both the Covington fight and the Burns fight
* Has great endurance - Shown in the Covington fight and the Woodley fight.
* Has a solid output - Shown in the Covington fight.

Whilst he may not be as durable as Mark Hunt, have the endurance of Holloway or the power and explosivity of Yoel Romero, there are very few athletes that have attained so many physically advantageous qualities. Fighters with great power tend to have lower outputs and poor endurance, fighters with great endurance tend to attain said endurance with reduced power.

The only other fighters that I can think of that  are as well rounded as Kamaru in terms of physicality would be GSP and maybe Anderson Silva.",Kamaru Usman may be the best athlete in MMA.,66,1

He made it clear that after you get KO'd, you are not in a right state of mind that someone pushes a microphone and a camera to your face and asks you difficult questions. I thought it was a wise decision to spare the dignity of the fighter, Joe and the UFC, all parties come out looking better. 

Then Daniel Cormier gets KO'd by his rival(and dirtbag), and Joe inexplicably interviews him and makes him a meme, a lot of dumb casual fans call DC a bitch etc... 

After that Joe for the most part did not interview KO'd fighters(I'm sure he did interview some, but I cannot remember), and other UFC commentators kinda did and did not interview. 

And now we get to 261, and Joe does it fucking again. He interviewed all the KO'd fighters on main card, worst of all being Zhang who was so obviously confused and lost, it was very unpleasant to watch. Masvidal was surprisingly coherent, but Joe could not have known that, it would have been safer to just not do it, unless Jorge insisted. 

So what gives, why does he do this again? For what? Some say something in the sense of ""Well he doesn't want to do it, but the UFC makes him do it!""

Sorry but how? If Joe tells the UFC he is not gonna do that, what the hell can they do about that? Fire him? And if they fire him, and he makes it public on why he got fired, just imagine the fire storm that would cause? But again, why would Joe even be afraid of that, as I said he has much stronger leverage on this, it is known that financially he doesn't not need the UFC pay, he could do this shit for free. And also, is this really the hill UFC needs to die on? Is interviewing KO'd people really that important to them? So important that they are risking huge PR problems? For what? There is not a soul that would make the decision of buying a PPV on whether Joe interviews a KO'd fighter.",Joe Rogan and interviewing KO'd fighters issues.,33,1

She is easily among the highest tier of female draws alongside Nunes and Shevchenko, but due to her style, personality and looks, she has the potential to become the second biggest name in women's combat sports history, behind Ronda Rousey.

Despite this, it is uncommon for women's fights to headline PPV's, as it usually only happens when no other champions are availlable, as was the case with UFC 250 for example. Rose though has headlined a PPV when she was slammed by Andrade at UFC 237, but I find it interesting how the UFC clearly values her as a draw due to her status in her last two fights. 

In the UFC 251 poster, her rematch with Andrade was featured, even though there were 3 other title fights on the card. Moreover, since the rematch was originally scheduled for UFC 249, the fight as the co-main to the event was also on the poster, even though the main event was the most anticipated fight of all time in Khabib vs. Ferguson. Even now at UFC 261, Zhang vs. Namajunas was ahead of Shevchenko vs. Andrade in the card, which is uncommon as generally fights at a higher weight classes take precedence on the card. 

All this, plus the possibility that Rose could hold onto the strawweight title for a while and defend her title multiples time, suggests to me that Namajunas can become one of the biggest draws in the game and a potential PPV headliner especially since the 115 division is clearly the most stacked in WMMA. The biggest problem however would be having to have worthy opponents with enough clout. Rematches with the other biggest names in the division, Zhang and Joanna could be possibilities, whilst other relative big names in the mix like Carla Esparza, Mackenzie Dern, Michelle Waterson and Angela Hill could also potentially work out.",Rose Namajunas' status as a PPV draw,77,1

I come on behalf of [mma-ds.com](https://mma-ds.com), where we use data science to analyse MMA and my colleague u/JayVeib developed an awesome algorithm called STeloR to predict fight outcomes and evaluate fighters. 

[This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgakZw6K1QQ&amp;ab_channel=StatQuestwithJoshStarmer) explains PCA extremely well, but all you need to know is that PCA takes a bunch of data points (a fighter's stats in this case) and makes a 2D visualization (a scatter plot) that explains most of the data variation. The x axis of this 2D plot is called the first principle component, or PC1 for short, and it's the most important one (explains the most data variance). Each PC can be thought of as a cocktail of features, and just like a Sex on the Beach has more vodka than whatever other manly drinks are in there, PCs can also have more of a specific feature.

My dataset only has 4 features: total strikes attempted (removed outliers and normalized) and % of shots to the head, body and legs. I'm using percentages instead of number of strikes so that the activity part isn't embedded into the other features, which would make the variables dependent. Also, I'm only considering data points that belong to our Striking Heavy class, which corresponds to fighters who only want to strike (read more about that here).

PCA will take this dataset and compute its principle components:

||activity|head%|body%|leg%|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|PC1|**-0.77**|\-0.52|0.20|0.32|
|PC2|0.64|\-0.62|0.26|0.36|
|PC3|\-0.021|\-0.09|0.75|\-0.65|

If we look at PC1, which is the most important PC, we can see that activity is its main ingredient. This is a strong indicator that activity is the most relevant feature out of the bunch (it's the feature that explains the most variance).

If we actually plot PC1 and PC2 and make the more active fighters darker, it's visible that activity changes across the PC1 axis:

Alright, so I was searching up UFC to see the cards coming up, then I found that article. I was read it and I saw the stupidest shit in there and imma debunk all of it. 

1. Uh, people can still have trainers while being as fit as possible, that's what exercise can also be? And not everyone wants to do MMA or get hit in the face in general, so how would the diet pill companies be ruined? Most of them don't ONLY make diet pills and if they do, that's on them.

2. Just change the channel... plus you can't keep them in a bubble for all their lives and if the parents don't feel comfortable with it, then they'll not tell them to do it. 

3. Yeah no shit, you want people to get raped or get hurt because they don't know proper self-defense?

4. And you want people to feel down on themselves? If so, cancel ALL sports, I haven't seen a single post about another sport similar to this. Oh my God this dude is a selfish and insecure piece of shit.

5. The police force and military have known MMA for such a long time possibly and who would win in a fight: 5 policemen who know MMA or 1 criminal who knows MMA?

6. Like I said, then talk about other sports because they do the same thing

7. Then just do the singular martial art... MMA is to learn MULTIPLE martial arts, that's why it says MIXED martial arts. It's not the sport of MMA's fault, it's the person.

8. Goddamn, the blatant sexism. MMA is also used for self defense like you said so it's a lower risk at getting raped or sexual harrassed by women.

9. The utter homophobia here and idiocy here... if it's such a sissy sport, then you try and get punched as hard as you can by Ngannou or chocked out by Nurmagomedov. 

10. Not even a real reason...

GSP’s wrestling is probably better but Kamaru is probably both bigger and stronger than him so it might not matter. He’s also still elite, even if lagging behind GSP here.

I'm also not a surgeon, so I won't pretend to know what I'm talking about regarding the details of the operation needed for that fracture. Instead, I wanted to give a short breakdown of Anthony Smith's excellent calf kick against Jimmy Crute (it's also just a more interesting topic to discuss IMO).

**Note**: the following is for general informational purposes only, not to serve as actual medical advice. See a doctor IRL if you wish to seek help for musculoskeletal or nerve injuries. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

[⠀](https://preview.redd.it/8o9weaawltv61.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f6f36b65ebda4d04143d4f313c079c69e67df36d)

*  Smith lands a kick just behind Crute's fibular head, hitting the common peroneal nerve before it divides into two branches: the superficial and deep peroneal nerves. This is a vulnerable area, not protected by much muscle or fat. The deep peroneal nerve powers the tibialis anterior muscle which is responsible for lifting up the fore foot when walking. The superficial peroneal feeds the peroneus longus and brevis, thin muscles along the outside of the lower leg which roll the ankle outward. ⠀

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wwnjo8i2mtv61.png?width=1080&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed5f95676a955a1f36eb027913cb357fdb69960f

* Without proper function of those muscles, the foot will drop down and roll inwards with attempted weight bearing. Nerve irritation can also cause pain and numbness along the outside of the calf and top of the foot. Crute's ability to properly defend himself was compromised at this point and continuing would have risked unnecessary injury. This, ladies and gentlemen, was an excellent doctor stoppage. ⠀⠀
* Crute's nerve injury was likely mild, involving temporary damage only to the outer myelin sheath due to compression. This is called neurapraxia. While symptoms may linger for up to several weeks, full recovery should be expected without the need for any surgery. Crute should maintain ankle ROM in the meantime, progressing to strengthening when tolerated. If recovery is slow, an electrodiagnostic study could be performed 3 weeks post-injury to determine if more serious nerve damage (such as disruption of the nerve itself) had occurred.⠀⠀

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ye5l6sn4mtv61.png?width=977&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c5f520d8d0bfb05852375cab6ed5975537d59042

* Crute was also scheduled for imaging of his left knee per Megan Olivi's post-fight report. The results of that study are still unknown, but hopefully there were no abnormalities. Both Smith's kick and the manner in which Crute falls appear to force the knee inward and forward, which could possibly stress ligaments and contribute further to leg instability. Knee soft tissue damage and other MSK injuries like lower leg fractures are sometimes associated with traumatic peroneal nerve injury as well, so evaluation is a good idea when indicated. ⠀
* From a technique standpoint, this finish was no fluke. Smith's jab and strike level changes kept Crute honest throughout the fight. He is also able to land the kick just as Crute is moving back with his lead leg off the ground and relaxed. Without a solid base, Crute was unable to properly check. This just goes to show how crucial proper set-up and timing are at the highest level of this sport.

Shout out to both Anthony Smith and Jimmy Crute for putting on a great fight. Smith showing he's still a veteran to be reckoned with, and Crute will be back soon enough.",[OC] A brief medical explanation of Anthony Smith's calf kick TKO of Jimmy Crute at UFC 261,82,1

He left the UFC whilst being ranked as #4 in the MW division. 


I beg the question, where does the Moose stand in MMA’s all time P4P rankings? I liken his situation as sort of a Bernard Hopkins type of legacy. Someone who’s remained disciplined enough to beat multiple elite opponents across different divisions and eras but has at times lost in key moments or not seized certain opportunities just enough for him not to be immortalised by the fans and commentators as he should be. 


I strongly feel that if he had won and defended a UFC title, he’d be immortalised as one of the best to ever do it, with his name alongside Silva’s in MW GOAT talks. 


Accolades: 
Two time and current Bellator MW Champ 
Former DREAM LHW Champ 
Former DREAM MW Champ 
Former Strikeforce LHW Champ 
Former Cage Warriors MW Champ


Notable names he’s beaten throughout his career 
(WW):

(MW):

As a fun side project I decided to start playing around with web scraping MMA data and packaging it into some nice interactive dashboards.

The google site above provides a window into stats from all UFC bouts and fighters since the second UFC event in 1994 (courtesy of UFC stats). I've put together a few different views:

* **Leader boards**: Fighters with the most fights, knockouts, subs etc.
* **Fighter Deep Dive**: A detailed look into a individual fighter, their fight history, striking stats etc.
* **Bout Deep Dive**: A mildly detailed look into a specific bout with strikes landed by round, control duration, takedowns, judges scorecards etc.
* **Bout Overview**: A high level summary of all fights, location, weight classes, outcomes etc.

I'll also warn that the dashboards can sometimes take minute or so to load fully - I'm currently trying to optimise the data in the back end to improve the load times.

Feedback, bug reports and ideas for more interesting charts/views would be very much appreciated, either in this thread or by DM.",MMA Data Dashboards and Insights,16,5

Another one is brandon vera.  We saw glimpses of it but it never came about.  


Of course we cannot forget Lee Murray. The original bad boy.  He could have had it all if he wasn’t a pos and had self control outside the cage.  He could have had a great UFC run.

No disrespect to the participants of bare knuckle completions.   However I see it as parallel to bum fights (which I find as incredibly sad).  It is basically taking advantage of people who want money and are willing to endure physical harm for it.

However, there are many 15 minute fights packed with action that deserve to be remembered. What are your 3-round fights of the year for each year? One rule, fight must go full 15 minutes - no finishes.

My subjective list:

2020 - Emmett vs Burgos. Absolute showcase of toughness from both guys. Emmett essentially fighting 15 minutes with no knee and Burgos eating punches like it's some mad food contest. No 3-rounder in 2020 comes close IMO, but for me the honorary mentions would be: Namajunas vs Andrade II, Fiziev vs Diakiese, and Fili vs Yusuff.

2019 - Tsarukyan vs Makhachev. Now, this one may differ from majority's pick, which, I assume, would be Romero vs Costa. And that fight is great. But the sheer level of grappling exchanges in Tsarukyan vs Makhachev! It was insane, that's how I wish most grappling exchanges looked. This fight had some of the most entertaining grappling I have ever seen. Runner-up, as said before: Romero vs Costa. 

2018 - Felder vs Perry. Ultimate JUST BLEED 15-minute fight. Headbutt in the 1st minute and insane amount of cuts and bruises in the next 14. Sheer toughness from both. Should be noted that it was a one week notice fight for Felder in the weight class above his own. Runner-up: Blachowicz vs Manuwa II.

2017 - Vannata vs Green. Controversial 1st round, 2 amazing rounds afterwards. Technique vs athleticism, tremendous heart showcase, BLOOD. It's all in this fight. Runner-up: Zaleski dos Santos vs Good.

2016 - Choi vs Swanson. Everyone knows this one and you can't forget it. Can't even describe the greatness of this fight with words. Everyone needs to watch this banger especially since Cub is fighting this Saturday. This fight was so great, I'm not even sure what could be its runner-up if anything even could. Maybe you guys could suggest some other fight, but I'm gonna go with Poirier vs Duffy, even though it might've not been as competitive as all the other fights on this list.

&amp;#x200B;

I haven't watched nearly as many fights from before 2016 compared to 2016-now (I actually watched every single card after I started watching in late 2017, and I came back to watch almost every card I missed since the beginning of 2016). Due to this, I would like you guys to continue this list, if you can, listing fights from earlier years.

*Abstract: A Dominick Reyes' career may be a step ahead of his opponent in this one.* 

Seven months after a deep, split decision victory over Thiago ""Marreta"" Santos, then-Light-Heavyweight-Champion and UFC enigma Jonny ""Bones"" Jones defended his championship against a then-undefeated Dominick Reyes. Reyes, riding a 6-fight win streak in the UFC, had accumulated an 11-0 pro MMA record - a record ""The Devastator"" fell short of extending. While perfection was blemished that night, little shame comes with a decision loss against the most successful LHW in UFC history. With another title opportunity (vs. current champ Jan Blachowicz) came another defeat just 19 weeks later, but Reyes' looks to turn the tides by delivering his opponent a familiar pill to swallow Saturday night: an end to an 11-fight win streak. Wherein the number finds similarity, the journey finds contrast. While ""The Devastator"" met Jon Jones for the UFC LHW strap in his 12th pro fight, Jiří Procházka has plenty to prove in his 31st where he'll make just his second trip to the UFC octagon. ""Denisa"" heel hook finished former UFC fighter and TUF cast member CB Dollaway in the first round of their 2019-closing fight before making his UFC debut vs. [Volkan Oezdemir last July. Prochazka brutally knocked out Oezdemir in that fight](https://youtu.be/knRMfWDjKZE) \- the latest in a fight-finishing-trend continuing for 4 years.

Any questions lingering over the limited UFC experience of Jiří could just as easily be outweighed by this impressive streak: spanning nine fights, seven of which ended in Round 1 . Whether or not you're convinced, oddsmakers have labeled the Czech Muy Thai kickboxer a betting favorite this Saturday, May 1st. Reyes has never lost a non-title fight in MMA and has no intentions to make this his first time.",Prochazka Will Transcend/Match Reyes' 11 Fight Win Streak at UFC Vegas 25,8,1

The first 2 cards of this season have been bangers. Great fights on both cards and awesome finishes. The production is top notch (love the camera angles and overall presentation) and the announcing team is really good with Sean O’Connell, Randy Couture and Kenny Florian ( love kenflo on commentary welcome back). The point system is cool but it doesn’t affect the fights in a negative way imo. Another thing I like is the incorporation of Verdict scorecards of the fans. It makes the fights so much more interactive having you be an active judge while watching the fights and being able to make fight predictions is awesome. Bellator cards have been solid but for the most part are boring sometimes. I’m not a huge fan of their commentary team. Mauro is annoying at times but Big John brings no excitement to the booth. His post fight interviews are boring and awkward as hell. I love  Big John but I think he excels at breaking down fights and up and coming matchups on the desk instead of the commentary booth.

Now you may be asking yourself, how could this be? Rory is in PFL and hasn't fought in the UFC since 2016!

Well if you're thinking that then you're just lacking some ~~weed~~ creativity

This plan is actually very simple, so simple in fact I can't believe I am the first to uncover it, but I looked at all sherdog forums and I watched every Schmo interview and found no mention of it.

You see it plays out like this:

Rory runs through the PFL tournament EZ Clap style basically looking like a dad beating up his kids at the family barbecue..and were talking an Alabama Dad who is a war veteran with a penchant for physical discipline. I mean just destroying those poor kids. 

Rory is uninjured and wins the million dollars much applauding and cheers, meanwhile Kamaru Usman has been running through everyone in the division he fights Colby and Wonderboy and no immediate challenger arises after that

So we have a problem for the UFC: Kamaru has cleaned out the division 

But we also have the solution: Rory MacDonald previous UFC title challenger has just won a MMA tournament on ESPN

And that word right there is the connection, the simple reason why this can happen: **ESPN**

With the UFC and PFL both being hosted on ESPN the crossover name recognition and easy promotion collaboration means Dana and the boys can easily bring the Red King back into the fold.

They can simply offer him a contract after the tournament or even trade for him ala Ben Askren - Mighty Mouse. Doesn't matter how it happens because it will happen. Dana has read The Art of the Deal at least once and knows how to get things done.

UFC can release a fighter any time.  (Which, btw, seems to be a contradiction to the point of a contract.)

If you're Jon Jones, Khamzat, Diego, or anyone, why sign a 10 fight contract?  From UFC's perspective, sure, it's great!  But as a fighter, there's no security or guarantee that you'll get all those 10 fights, so why not just go from 1 fight contract to another?

Unless... when a fighter is released by UFC before their contract, are they compensated?",What's the point of signing a multi-fight contract with UFC for the fighters? There doesn't seem to be any benefit.,22,1

""These are my last 4 fights and I just want to finish on a high note""

Everyone has seen part 2 of this video that starts with Fabia already arguing with the UFC staff. It's the more obviously ""juicy"" video after all. And I hadn't seen the first one myself. Nor do I see it posted here. But I went back today to watch it, and I genuinely believe this is the more interesting video. 

Diego says that he's learned who he is as a person, and not just as a fighter under Fabia. It seems like maybe an underlying identity crisis with the rapid approach of retirement may have played a significant role in Fabia worming his way into Diego's life. With his identity so wrapped up in fighting, and his career waning, he was very vulnerable to a charlatan like Fabia, but more than that Fabia was there as Diego sort of redefined himself as a person.

He was very confident he had 4 fights left, and that was that. He was set on retiring in 4 fights. Which is probably a good thing, and maybe one of the few good things Fabia has done for him. Whether directly convincing him to retire, or giving him something outside of fighting so he can retire. Unfortunately it seems that his identity outside of fighting is tied to Fabia.

He has some medical issues. He talked about how he had a surgery on his shoulder, he has ""torn joints"", and he needs surgery but cant take the time for it right now. So he's relying on ""alternative medicine"". He also got himself a stem cell sponsorship. He found a sponsor that is paying him in stem cell treatments rather than cash apparently. He planned on going after his fight. Since this video was for the Jake Matthews fight, it stands to reason he did get the treatment. 

However, interestingly after the fighter meeting with Diego was closed and Fabia started going after the UFC staff there for the media coverage of him, Diego nods along when Olivi responds. I'm probably grasping at straws and forcing something to mean something when it doesn't because I like Diego, but it almost seems like he knows Fabia is wrong here.

Stephan Bonnar definitely seems to have been dragged in. Originally I thought Bonnar had come in because he saw Diego desperately needed a real coach, but the video doesn't make that seem true. Diego says he was training in Vegas at the PI with Fabia a lot, and that's where they met, and Bonnars team apparently meshed well with his, and now Bonnar stood in the room filming this mess. Also, Fabia references both of them believing in him while at the end of the video.",Breaking down Part 1 of Diego Sanchez' fighter meeting.,38,1

Add 10 pounds to all current weight classes. Allow an additional 10 lbs to be cut to get into preferred weight class. I am sure almost everyone cuts at least 10 lbs, so this would make it healthier for fighters by giving them the first 10 lbs free. Then, they have the option of cutting an optional 10 lbs, which seems to not be too damaging to one’s health. You’d compare this to their fighting weight when they enter the ring and making sure it’s not greater than 10 lbs. You can fine those who do not meet this criteria accordingly. This would keep decent cutters in their current weight class while making people like Costa move up a weight class (or lose some muscle mass). If not the optional 10, I think adding 10 lbs to all weight classes will GREATLY help these fighters since everyone is cutting at least that already. 

It might make some fighters go in dehydrated to avoid putting on too much weight, but that already seems to be happening. Give me your opinions!",Would this new weight cut protocol work?,17,1

Hey guys, I've been a hardcore MMA fan since the first season of The Ultimate Fighter in 2005 and am finally getting around to sharing my takes (which I like to think are pretty good!)  In this video, I briefly go over the co-main event between OG featherweight puncher Cub Swanson and the underrated European karateka Giga Chikadze, who's 5-0 in the UFC with 4 Ws in 2020 alone.   I break down the main event by looking back on Reyes' most recent 2 bouts, a close losing effort over 5 rounds with Jon Jones, followed by a stoppage loss to Jan Blachowicz. Then I recap Jiri Prochazka's debut KO win over Volkan Oezdemir and talk about what patterns I observed in these fights and how they may affect the outcome of Saturday's bout.

He's 0-2-1 and fought only pro wrestlers: Shinsuke Nakamura and ""Dr. Death"" Steve Williams. He actually won the first fight against Nakamura, but was overturned because Nak said he wasn't out. One year later, in 2004, he KO'd Dr. Death in the first round and fought Nakamura for a second time just a few months later. This time, ""King of Strong Style"" won via submission and Ignashov never competed again in MMA. 

Fun facts: On 20th May 2003, Ignashov KO'd Semmy Schilt in Amsterdam, two days later he fought Nakamura in Saitama, Japan. 

Another fun fact: His first pro fight (Muay Thai) was against another legendary kickboxer, Remy Bonjasky. The future two time K1 Grand Prix winner won via UD.

Yes, Czechs speak a Slavic language and are Slavic, but they aren't exactly thrilled about that--Czechs are about the most anti Pan-Slavic people on earth. They're usually quick to point out their Germanic and Celtic heritage to compensate for being lumped together with Russians and Serbians and other Slavs whom they aren't terribly similar to in culture or mentality.

Also, while there are tough Czechs, that's not exactly what they're known for. And while Procházka can be a bruiser, he's an intelligent and articulate guy.

Out of the twelve fights, three betting favorites “lost” (more on that later), and Kamaka is one of those unfortunately. Regardless of how you felt about the outcome and the body of work Kamaka had last night, a loss is a loss, and having lost 2/3 of his UFC fights does not bode well for Kamaka. First losing by a KO and then a split decision. There is still some hope as he has shown that he is a capable striker with a powerful punch and the split decision and potnential robbery only lands him at 5

4. Luke Sanders

Another favorite who lost, but gets 4th due to losing by a unanimous decision. Sanders took a round off of Colares, but over 3 rounds Colares proved to be the better fighter. Another reason for him being a loser is because of his spotty record, he is stuck in limbo. Since having a KO victory in February 2019, Sanders has lost two in a row as well, and things are looking up. At 35, it will be interesting to see where he can go from here, but being a slight favorite and opening the card up with a loss does not bode well.

3. Dominick Reyes

Reyes was a slight underdog, but was a championship contender for his last two fights and many thought he could outlast Prochazka and hit him with a good hit or grapple with the youngster. Although the first round was exciting with either fighter looking like they could knock the other out, Jiri ended up on top. This fight could have propelled Reyes back into title contention, but the brutal knockout will slide him further down now with three straight loses. Although an underdog, he gets the third spot because even with a valiant effort, this loss was brutal for his chances especially with other Light heavyweights racking up wins.

2. Poliana Botelho

Botelho was the biggest favorite to lose, thus she gets the 2nd ranking in the top five losers. Although she was handled easily by Gillian Robertson a few months ago, Botelho looked to have an easy win wit ha relatively new UFC fighter in Carolina with only 3 UFC fights under her belt. But her fighting style didn’t win her the match and she got gassed by the 2nd round. This is not a good look for her ad overall was a pretty ugly fight ending in a decision. There is something to be said with Carolina missing weight, but Botelho should have won easily.

1. Ion Cutelaba

Ion Cutelaba was in contention for biggest loser even before the fight began. At weight-ins Ion went and grabbed Jacoby during the stare down and after what happened with the Klose-Stephens fight, that should be a no-no. Cutelaba had to go out on Saturday and prove he was worthy of those shenanigans after getting absolutely handled by Ankalaev in the rematch. Cutelaba started very strong in what should have been a 10-7 match with a point deduction with a ton of takedowns and with Jacoby just trying to stay alive with fence grabs. But Ion got gassed and the next two rounds went to Jacoby and thus resulting in a draw. Ion probably would have not been my biggest loser if was a composed fighter during the weight-ins because many fighters get gassed after the first round; it happens to great fighters, but his shenanigans and with the fight ending in a draw, It is just all L’s for Ion

Honorable Mention:  Aleksandar Rakić 

Although the No.2 Light Heavyweight didn’t appear on the card, he still comes in as an honorable loser. Rakic’s last fight was at UFC 259 were he won by a unanimous decision against Thiago Santos. Although winning easily, it was not a pretty fight. He went 0/2 on takedowns and only landed 50/103 total strikes in three rounds. For reference, Jiri in less than 2 rounds landed 78. For Rakic to fight the winner of the Reyes/Jiri fight or even get into title conention, Jiri or Reyes would have had to show they weren’t ready for a title fight, whether it would be a sloppy fight, a split decision, or some other reason that would essentially force Rakic to fight the winner. But with Jiri’s dominating performance, it would be incredibly stupid to book Rakic/Jiri instead of just having Jiri fight the winner of the Jan/Texeira fight. There is a problem that that fight is in September, so they might book Rakic/Jiri anyways. But either way, Rakic is not in a good spot with how well Jiri is proving himself

Top Five Winners

5. TJ Brown

In what was a fight of the night contender, TJ brown finally got his first win in the UFC. The fight was back and forth and both men gave it their all, with Brown endeing up on top. Brown went 2/4 on takedowns and landed 110 strikes. The fight was incredibly close and was incredibly entertaining, but Brown prevailed and comes in at number 5.

4. Sean Strickland

Strickland is a feel good story. After taking two years off due to a motorcycle incident, he has come back and won all three of his fights in incredible fashion. He has been poised, has incredibly striking ability, and just looks like a great fighter. He comes in at 5, not only because of this, but because Jotko, his opponent came in with a three win streak and was a sneaky underdog some sites were picking to get an upset. Overall, Strickland could be higher, but his huge favorite status puts him at 4 on the list.

3. Merab Dvalishvili 

Merab and Cody Stamann, his opponent, were ranked 12th and 13th in the Bantamweight rankings before the fight, but Merab came as a huge favorite. In an incredible fight with lots of actions, Merab took home the Unanimous decision with 178 strikes landed, 5 takedowns, and a great 15 minute performance. Stamann put up a good fight, landed a lot of strikes as well and having some control time, but Merab comes out and gets his 6th UFC win in a row and should see his rankings improve. The Bantamweight division is probably the most stacked division in terms of contenders, and Merab keeps climbing up the rankings and will probably be there in a fight or 2.

2. Giga Chikadze

Technically not the only first round win on the card, (with the Markos DQ in the first round), Giga has a mega performance last night wit ha first round finish when he kicked Cub Swanson in the body and probably broke something. Giga has won all 6 of his UFC fights, with his last two coming by TKO’s, Giga should make a huge jump in the featherweight rankings and comes in at the No.2 winner of the night. Not much else to say other than that

1. Jiri Prochazka

No one was a bigger winner than Jiri Prochazka. After only two UFc fights, the former RIZIN champion has proven he belongs in the UFC. He has won his last ten fights with knockouts, and although there were times in fight against Reyes were fans were worried he could get knocked out by Reyes, Jiri ended the fight with a brutal elbow that sent Reyes to the shadow realm. It was and incredible performance and proved that he doesn’t need to fight Rakic to contend for a championship. He should be next in line for Jan or Texeira.

 \- Was also surprised with Reyes defense when going back and ability to counter even when under pressure, was very complimentary of him, says the shots were very hard  
 \- No reaction to Rakic talks, focus it what the negotiation will be with UFC, not with Rakic  
 \- Plans to keep the haircut for next fights (only wants to substitute the artifical hair parts for his own hair going forward)

Eugene Bareman appeared out of nowhere to most of us and was just this MMA guru putting out some of the best talent in the world. He was well spoken, thought out, and at the time seemed like he was so confident in his pupils he'd put them against the toughest challenges whenever it was offered. They were clean sweeping events. It was almost a foregone conclusion to bet on any CKB fighter.

Something seems different right now. They aren't finding as much success in the cage, but its as though Eugene let the earlier success get to his head and he thinks he's Sean Shelby.

Not long ago he was saying Israel would gladly fight Stipe. But now he's scared of a guy his star pupil KOd inside two rounds? What the hell is going on?


Eugene is a very smart man and one of the greatest minds in the game. He is able to pick opponents apart and gameplay perfectly. So, did Jan expose something that Eugene sees as a problem for Israel? Does his pupil need more time to prepare for that fight and that's why it seems he's doing anything possible to avoid the rematch? Or do they really just think because of the nature of the first fight they shouldn't give the former champ the rematch?


This post isn't to just shit on CKB. More of a discussion.

I did some thinking and thought of two potential plans for ranking fighters and keeping things moving. 

For the first plan, say, unranked fighters must fight and win at least 3 fights in a row in order to fight rank 20-10 guys (maybe if you're finishing fights you could do it in 2 wins). If the unranked fighter beats the top 20-10 fighter, you hop in front of him in the rankings. Guys ranked 20-10 must beat 3 unranked fighters in a row or 2 fighters ranked 20-10 (maybe if you're finishing fights you must beat 2 unranked fighters in a row or 1 fighter ranked 20-10) in order to fight fighters ranked 10-1. If you refuse to fight certain fights the UFC could drop you back to the next lower tier. Longterm recovery injuries would remove you immediately from the rankings but it when you returned you could get your spot back potentially. 

For 2nd plan: A similar system that removed rankings but had a common tier (basically newer additions to the promotion or people that lose a lot), a middle tier (guys who have beat 3 common tier fighters in a row \[2 if finishes\]), and a top tier (guys that have beaten 3 middle tier guys in a row \[2 if finishes\]). If you lose 2-3 times in your tier in a row you get dropped to the next lower tier. 

Not sure if either of these would work at all but I was wondering about the benefits and the complications that could arise from such plans. I haven't heard of any type of plans similar to these before, and also wondered if something like these plans existed in any mma promotion. Please share any thoughts you may have or any additions/subtractions you think the plans would benefit from.",2 Potential Ranking Plans,7,1

*Note: I understand the last clip has been posted here before but I would like to show how their attitude towards Rob's declining of the title shot has done a complete 180 since November and to also fill people in on the details of the situation that they may be missing.*



**Summary:**


At first, Adesanya is okay with Rob turning down the title shot back in November. Rob had just fought and he understands Rob wants to spend time with his family during Christmas. Adesanya says he plans to do the same. This was when Dana was saying Rob turned the fight with Adesanya down and ""Didn't want to fight"" etc etc. When in reality, Rob just wanted the fight to be after Christmas. He had just fought on Oct 24, 2020.



Then Adesanya takes a fight with Jan. Rob also takes another fight with Kelvin. Logically, activity should serve as placeholder for Rob. However, now Adesanya and his team say that (despite being sympathetic, understanding, and even agreeing with Rob turning it down back in Nov) that Rob is now ""At the back of the line"" and that he should have taken it. Their new aggressive stance on this has a very stark contrast to how they were taking about it in November.",Some interview clips that show the change of Adesanya's tune towards Rob's title shot.,20,1

The second post will be about whether there are any correlations between factors. Eg.

* (Are those who practice martial arts more hardcore fans?
* Is there a link between period of following MMA and how casual/hardcore they are as a  fan?)

We also look into whether social factors have an impact on how casual/hardcore we are as fans.  Eg.

* Is having UFC fans as friends in your social circle associated with higher fan engagement?

=================================

This next section talks about fan engagement. Basically, I used it as a metric to assess how casual/hardcore we are as MMA fans. Fan engagement is assessed on a continuum from 1 (very unengaged or casual) to 5 (highly engaged or hardcore).

&amp;#x200B;

Fan engagement is an average score from the 7 questions below. The questions were answered using a scale of 1 (Strongly disagree) to 5 (Strongly agree).

&amp;#x200B;

“I regularly watch UFC events”

“I am excited for most UFC events”

“Most of the time, I watch other fights on the main card in addition to the main event”

“Most of the time, I watch the undercard fights”

“I consider myself a hardcore fan”

“I can name at least 3 fighters in most UFC weight classes”

“I am engaged in the UFC and MMA community on social media (Facebook,  Youtube, Instagram, Reddit etc)”

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the time when a fighter wins the belt it's a major realization of a personal journey. Even if they might not be thought of as the best in the world at the time their accomplishment still tends to get celebrated. Think Michael Bisping after he beat Rockhold. Nobody really thought Left Hand Larry was numero uno, but people gave him his respect. He had spent his career as the bridesmaid and finally, at last, managed to find a way to get it done. 

There are however, numerous fighters who have won the belt and never received that acclaim. Some of them were like Bisping. Decent fighters who managed to capture lightning in a bottle. Others weren't however. They were top tier fighters who just couldn't keep their footing at the summit.

With all that in mind, I think these are probably my personal picks for unheralded champions. 

First and foremost in my mind is Rafael Dos Anjos. I mentioned Alvarez at the jump and I could probably max out my character limit on lightweight champions alone. Ben Henderson was the king of the split decision and wasn't exactly beloved during his run and is even more forgotten about since. When most people think of Pettis these days they think of what could have been. Hell, even the once legendary BJ Penn is now more known for drunken antics and hard to watch performances than he is as an amazingly ferocious, small, bald ball of fury. You could make the argument that BJ Penn held the lightweight title while also having a claim to being a top 5 welterweight. An amazing accomplishment regardless of era. Then there's Sean Sherk. Which is a story all it's own. Rafael Dos Anjos sticks out to me even amongst that group. 

Dos Anjos really was the perfect storm for ""underappreciated champion."" A Brazilian with a decent grasp of English but far from a bombastic personality. A decently exciting fighter, but not necessarily a head turner. 50% career decision rate. Fairly normally looking guy. Really the most notable thing about him on paper (aside from his fighting career obviously) is he was a high level BJJ guy. Despite having a legitimate claim to top 5 status in his division he really wasn't seen as the best when he won the belt. Khabib had beaten him previously. Plus, he was going up against Anthony Pettis. Who at the time was basically the second coming in the UFC's eyes. Anybody who has heard the term, ""MMA"" in the last 10 years has probably seen the Showtime Kick. He was on the Wheaties box! Pettis faced a setback in his debut against an aging Guida, but ended up capturing the belt via first round submission against a guy who was notoriously difficult to submit. His win over Gilbert was thought to be his coronation in a certain sense. Coming off a season of TUF to hype it up. There was talk of an Aldo/Pettis superfight once the Conor question was answered, and you could be forgiven for laboring under the idea that the UFC would have been all too happy to make Conor/Pettis in the event he won. Dos Anjos was practically an afterthought. Hell, the lines closed at -450 for Pettis and +400 for RDA. 

Enter the unassuming Brazilian with perhaps my favorite performance in MMA to date. You have to remember, Gilbert was thought of as a huge threat to Pettis because he could put him against the fence. Pettis dealt with that and submitted him in a way that almost looked routine. What was a guy thought of as primarily a striker with some BJJ in his back pocket gonna do? He's gonna control the octagon like a reverse Kalib Starnes is what he's gonna do. An absolute masterclass in cage craft. When I watch a less dynamic striker take on a kicker I still think of RDA's gameplan half a decade later. Five rounds of utter control by a +400 underdog in the champ's supposed area of expertise. I can not gush about this fight enough.

Unfortunately, it wouldn't be enough to get RDA over the hump. Despite his world beater performance and a dominant defense against Donald Cerrone (that I had forgotten about until now tbh). RDA would never really garner any major acclaim with fans at large. He'd lose his belt against Alvarez in the first round and would go up to welterweight. Currently he exists still as a top level fighter, but perhaps not championship level in most people's eyes. Pettis' notoriety before, Conor, and then Khabib would all overshadow RDA's reign.  

No mention of disrespected UFC champions would be complete without Big Tim Sylvia. What can I say about Tim other than, ""oh Tim."" Tim was a UFC heavyweight champion during a time in that division many consider best forgotten (it's still real to me damnit!). On top of that he's also a walking, talking cringe factory. Seriously, despite being a 6'8 professional fighter and champion very little of what Tim said didn't come across like that one kid in your friend group that tried too hard. Combine that with the fact that Tim's fighting ability wasn't... great. He was a plodding striker, always open for the overhand, who, despite apparently having a background in wrestling and some grappling experience, seemed to eschew the ground game outside of trying to finish the fight. There would be several instances in his career where he would leave his arm in to get armbarred and would escape by standing up and slamming his opponent. This would cost him against Frank Mir. Despite all of that, Sylvia was a rangy striker who hit fairly hard (as can probably be expected of a 6'8 heavyweight). Which was enough for the UFC at the time. He also had regrettable styling decisions and a shitty nickname. Though those might be more personal gripes.  His championship career could best be classified as uninspired. He beat Ricco Rodriguez for the belt. Much like Sean Sherk that's a story all it's own. He was stripped for failing the post fight drug test and would get another shot in his fight against Mir. Which he would lose when Mir broke his arm. 

After Mir's motorcycle accident the championship lane was wide open for Big Tim. He would wind up with an interim title fight against Arlovski after beating Wes Sims. He would lose via sub in the first round but this kicked off something of a resurgence for Big Tim. He would win three in a row, rematch Arlovksi, return the favor via first round finish, and then demand a hotly anticipated rematch. Cue probably the worst fight in heavyweight championship history. Fairly decent first two rounds, but Arlovski would go gun shy (as he is wont to do) and Tim would stick behind the world's shittiest jab for the next three rounds. He would defend against Jeff Monsoon and then be upset by Randy Couture in his return. He would hold off a hyped up Brandon Vera before losing another interim bout against Big Nog. He would then jump ship for Affliction, look like shit against Fedor, and then lose in embarrassing fashion against retirement home ready Rey Mercer. This would kick off a further series of humiliations for Big Tim. He would move to super heavyweight, his weight would balloon up reportedly close to 400 pounds, he would be denied a fighting license by an Indian Reservation athletic commission given his size. Which those commissions were notorious for being willing to sanction just about anything. He would also release the regrettable ""beast mode"" training video. Which would include probably the worst push ups by a, ""professional athlete"" you're likely to see. Along with a vow to return to the UFC. 

Despite his clearly very storied career Tim didn't only receive a lack of respect and acclaim from fans. He received it from his own camp if rumors are to be believed. Apparently, early on Tim caught nothing but hell from his teammates at the legendary Miletich Fighting System camp. He was well known to cry after every practice. Even after he started experiencing success as a fighter Matt Hughes would continue to shit on him. 

Despite the unending series of personal degradations Big Tim remained fairly solid in strict regards to W/L up until the end. His last four fights would be a NC and and then a three fight skid. His first and last since the Nog-Fedor-Mercer skid. Only the second such losing streak of his career. That NC would come in a rematch against Arlovski. Big Tim would get dropped but ONE's confusing soccer kick rules resulted in a NC. Though as a long time Andrei fan I have to admit it was gratifying getting to see him soccer kick the Maine-iac. 

Last mention of Big Tim far as I can tell is he developed an arm infection as a result of his broken arm vs. Frank Mir. He would ask the UFC for help and be shot down. Fortunately his appeal to fans for help would work from what I can tell. The hits don't stop coming for a man who was once in a multi way tie for most times holding the UFC heavyweight belt and most consecutive title defenses in that division. 

This has gotten way long in the tooth. So I'll wrap it up with probably my personal favorite. Bigg Rigg Johnny Hendricks. Hendricks was a destroyer on his way to the title. His early UFC career he would go 7-1, but his coming out party was against Jon Fitch. A long standing, top tier welterweight who was thought of as second only to GSP. He would blast him 48 seconds into the first signaling an end to that era in the welterweight division. This would begin a series of performances that would alternate between disappointing and incredible. He would beat an over the hill Josh Koscheck by split, ransack a surging Martin Kampmann, then earn his title shot by beating Carlos Condit. Which he had to lay and pray to win. Something that soured a contingent of fans. After the Condit fight Hendricks would take part in three of the best fights in UFC title history. Headed into the GSP fight he wasn't a major underdog, but most people thought of him as a long shot. He was seen, in a certain sense, as the new version of Josh Koscheck. Predominantly a wrestler who could sneak in powerful shots. A lot of people thought his fight against GSP would go much like Koscheck's. It didn't. Hendricks took St. Pierre to the absolute limit through five rounds. Since losing the belt to Matt Serra you could probably pinpoint two instances where George St. Pierre wasn't absolutely dominating his opponent. The round he lost against Jake Shields, and the head kick he ate against Condit. Outside of those two moments GSP was virtually flawless. Nobody could touch him. Hendricks touched him a lot. GSP walked away with the split, but it was a near, near thing.

The fan's view of Hendricks would turn acrimonious after this fight. Not because of anything that happened during the fight, but because of comments he made after the fight. Hendricks said something along the lines of ""I was putting about 70% on him."" In the post fight presser. Many fans took that to mean Hendricks only gave about 70% effort in the bout. Which many people mocked him for given who he was fighting and how close it was. This wasn't what Hendricks was saying though. What he was saying was that he only threw about 70% power because he had been criticized for gassing out in previous fights (namely Condit) and this was his first five round bout. Hendricks was, broadly, a bit more dismissive of GSP's performance in the post fight presser and his place in the welterweight title picture. His contention was that he had won. He didn't try to put forward that he only performed at 70%. 

This post fight presser was a bit controversial all around as Dana would also toss some dirt on GSP only to change his tune once GSP walked in. 

He would go on to face Robbie Lawler in an incredible fight for the vacant title. One he would ultimately win. He would lose the immediate rematch, another amazing though slightly less so fight, and begin a career freefall that wouldn't truly stop until he retired. He seemed unable to deal with the new generation of fighters and even took an ill-advised trip up to middleweight. 

The reasons for his fall from grace were oft debated. Some said it was simply damage accumulated from three separate, five round wars. Others said it was just a lack of focus. He had dipped his toes into several other business ventures that didn't appear to pan out. Finally, there was a large contingent that contended his fall from grace was too conspicuously timed with USADA's emergence in the sport. It was thought that if he didn't use PEDs he might have at least relied on diuretics to make weight. Which he struggled with in his post championship career. It also bares mentioning that prior to the GSP fight there was a controversy surrounding steroids and testing between GSP and Hendricks. They both agreed to do additional testing but GSP wanted WADA and Hendricks wanted USADA if memory serves. Fans of either fighter would use this to smear the opponent as a steroid cheat. Though the view widely held now seems to be that Johnny was dodging the tests. Despite that and a grand amount of posturing to the best of my knowledge neither fighter completed any additional testing. 

I know I didn't get to everybody, but these guys are kind of the quintessential underappreciated champions in my eyes. Let me know what you think.",UFC Champions Who Never Got the Respect They Deserved,254,1

Some other prominent fighters ranked against each other on the T-Rex - Gorilla scale below. Unsurprisingly contrary to popular meming, Chad Mendes is a perfect ""Square"" with a reach to height ratio of 1.

*Abstract: “MMA’s League” follows up two exciting events with more, high-level fighters at PFL 3 this Thursday.*

Eleven years ago, Fabricio “Vai Cavalo” Werdum was preparing for his third of four eventual Strikeforce fights. [As a heavy +405 underdog](https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/bouts/979-strikeforce-fabrcio-vai-cavalo-werdum-vs-the-last-emperor-fedor-emelianenko), Werdum was slated to face the apparently unbeatable, enigmatic “Last Emperor” Fedor Emelianenko. In just seconds, [Vai Cavalo had been floored by the Heavyweight king, but it took only 69 for Werdum to force Fedor to tap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2S6ryNBtQA&amp;ab_channel=UFC-UltimateFightingChampionship) – a legend in and of itself. The current PFL Heavyweight continued to post victories in 9 of 10 fights as he transitioned back to the UFC. He became interim UFC champion along the way before meeting his fate nearly 5 years ago against Stipe Miocic. Stipe has since held the UFC heavyweight strap for most of that time and unlike many UFC fighters, Werdum left the MMA big league with a victory – one over LHW title challenger Alexander Gustafson in the first round via armbar. [Werdum appears motivated to add a PFL Championship to his list of accolades](https://youtu.be/mdOBmvUyA3M) and the first step in that journey begins this Thusday, May 6th on ESPN and ESPN2 in the main event vs. Renan “Problema” Ferreira, a 6-2 fighter with a 100% finish rate, win or loss.

Justin “Big Pretty” Willis had been booked to bounce back from his only UFC defeat, a [March 2019 decision bout against Curtis “Razor” Blaydes](https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/bouts/407298-ufc-on-espn-6-curtis-razor-blaydes-vs-justin-big-pretty-willis), but had to pull out from the fight. Willis most notably defeated the “Super Samoan” Mark Hunt in December of 2018 during his 4-1 stint in the UFC. He’ll be replaced by Mo DeReese (3-2 PFL), a contestant on TUF 23 to fill in against Dennis Golstov (3-1 PFL) in one of four Heavyweight bouts Thursday. 

Complimenting the Heavyweights, PFL veteran Kayla Harrison sets off to reclaim her throne as champion. An accomplished judoka [(45-7 over 7 years)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kayla_Harrison#Judo_record), not only is Harrison undefeated in her 8-fight pro MMA career spanning just under 3 years (7-0 PFL, 1-0 Invicta) ,  [she went undefeated (8-0) at both the 2012 and 2016 Olympic games in Judo, earning two gold medals.](https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/34265-kayla-harrison) She’ll face streaking featherweight Mariana Morais – [a gigantic underdog](https://www.bestfightodds.com/events/pfl-2021-3-werdum-vs-ferreira-2111) in her PFL debut. Ronda Rousey’s former training partner and judoka colleague may be as safe as bet as they come, but as with any fight, Morais posseses a “punchers’ chance.”","2021 PFL 3 Features 4 UFC ""Vets"", Undefeated Harrison",12,1

When you hear the fighter speak about tiring out towards the end or the broadcast team point out a loss of energy, what exactly does that feel like physically for the fighter?    


I know when I lift weights or do exercises on muscles I haven’t worked, I get that immediate jelly like feeling where it’s tough to control the muscle. Is it similar to that? Or what would be the best way to describe that loss of energy that the announcers will always say “he’s gotta be careful he doesn’t punch himself out” or similar.

**(Note, i´m not american, so MMA gyms are not as common here, and tend to be much more expensive than regular martial arts classes )**  


# BJJ/Judo

I put them together because i´d probably take both classes if I were to choose either one of them, because one classe ends at 7PM, and the other stars at 7:15, and both are last an hour each, and best of all, the couches in both are legit black belts, and in the case of the BJJ one, he even trained in Brazil. Though if I were to choose these, it would be very expensive, since i´d be paying for 2 classes instead of one

# Tae Kwon Do:

This class is the one that interests me the least, its even ore expensive than paying for both BJJ and Judo, and I don´t think I woul be able to use apply TKD in a self defense scenario as easily as I could with the other martial arts, further more, you go up a belt each 3 months in this Dojo, so i´d have to pay additional money on top of the already high as fuck monthly fee,  though I´d like to learn how to kick

# Aikido:

# Karate Shotokan:

Before the pandemic there used to be more people, but now they just train little kids, and I could go in, but I´m not interested in training with kids

# Boxing: 

This one is the cheapest, and best of all, I can train the most here, its 2hrs a day 5 days a week, but I can train up to 6 hrs in one day if I so choose to(Though I probs wouldn´t train that much, lol), and the coach is very well known in the city, he has trained most of the other coaches in town and has even trained people who eventually competed in the olympic selection, and I already have a pair of gloves, head gear, bandages and mouth pieces. best deal IMO",Which martial art is better as a base for MMA?,12,1

**(Note, i´m not american, so MMA gyms are not as common here, and tend to be much more expensive than regular martial arts classes )**

# BJJ/Judo

I put them together because i´d probably take both classes if I were to choose either one of them, because one classe ends at 7PM, and the other stars at 7:15, and both are last an hour each, and best of all, the couches in both are legit black belts, and in the case of the BJJ one, he even trained in Brazil. Though if I were to choose these, it would be very expensive, since i´d be paying for 2 classes instead of one

# Tae Kwon Do:

This class is the one that interests me the least, its even ore expensive than paying for both BJJ and Judo, and I don´t think I woul be able to use apply TKD in a self defense scenario as easily as I could with the other martial arts, further more, you go up a belt each 3 months in this Dojo, so i´d have to pay additional money on top of the already high as fuck monthly fee, though I´d like to learn how to kick

# Aikido:

It´s expensive, and its Aikido, lol

# Karate Shotokan:

Before the pandemic there used to be more people, but now they just train little kids, and I could go in, but I´m not interested in training with kids

# Boxing:

This one is the cheapest, and best of all, I can train the most here, its 2hrs a day 5 days a week, but I can train up to 6 hrs in one day if I so choose to(Though I probs wouldn´t train that much, lol),it has weight lifting and calistenics equipment to put on some pounds while training and the coach is very well known in the city, he has trained most of the other coaches in town and has even trained people who eventually competed in the olympic selection, and I already have a pair of gloves, head gear, bandages and mouth pieces. best deal IMO

Note: I´m already taking classes in boxing somewhere else, but for reasons I´ll leave the gym where I am currently training and move to one of the classes in the sports centre as mentioned before",Which class should I choose?,14,1

But, the more I think about it; I think the problem with trying to wrestle Ngannou is that you have to get in close more often, so you’re more vulnerable to taking shots, plus you’re hands are gonna be down more often if you’re shooting a lot. So, I think that being able to stay on the outside is probably the better strategy against Ngannou.  
Next, as far as the striking: I also thought that Stipe would always have the advantage in striking simply because he has much better boxing, as far as technique. But for Ngannou, the problem with Stipe’s style is that he eats a lot of shots because he’s in the pocket a lot. So, that style is super dangerous when it’s against a guy with so much power.  
Now, when it comes to Gane: His striking involves a lot more distance than someone like Stipe. He also has **excellent** head movement, and is almost never standing still, so it’s much harder to land big shots on him. Gane also uses a ton of nasty kicks, and not only do those kicks do serious damage, they also allow him to stay on the outside and avoid punches.  
Gane also seems to have great cardio, which is obviously a huge factor against Ngannou.  
Those things, along with the fact that his striking is phenomenal … Make me think that he has a really good shot at beating Francis.

Am I crazy?","I think Cyril Gane’s style and level of talent, is exactly what it takes to beat Ngannou. Thoughts?",29,1

I've been thinking of joining a local UFC gym later this year. Y'know, once covid gets dealt with.

I'm 25 and in pretty good shape. More on that later. I have a lot of energy, like, too much. Stamina and endurance could use some improvement, though. I'm not sure if this is important to know, but I can take a beating. I can take a beating like a Nokia 3310. And I have very high pain tolerance.

I know how to fight, not well, but I know how. I took karate when I was a kid. I wasn't great at it. I got about halfway to black belt in about 2 years. Before that, I was a competitive swimmer, and I have the V-shape to prove it.

I'm also quite strong. A lot stronger than I look. I'm 5ft 10in and about 145 lbs, but I can deadlift 285 lbs, curl 40 lbs in each arm, and run extremely fast. My core is quite strong too. Unfortunately, calling my bench press ""pathetic"" is a severe understatement. I can barely do a single rep of 120 lbs. Not sure how that worked out. I have a wicked left hook and an even better right hook.

I'm a former cocaine addict and recovering alcoholic. I've been cocaine-free for several months. I still smoke, though. Cigarettes. Not weed.

So, I guess what I'm asking is, should I join? I feel like I'm too old. I'm not interested in joining the UFC or anything like that. I'm just interested in getting in shape and filling my time with something energy-draining. Sure I could run or swim or whatever, but I like to fight. I like getting hit, and I like hitting stuff. Punching bags don't punch back, though. But at least it's something.

Thanks for reading.",Thinking of joining a local UFC gym later this year. I could use some advice beforehand.,21,1

Harris walks his legs closer to Aguilera's legs to assist pushing Aguilera's head towards his own belly to lock the choke tighter; support hand goes closer to the near shoulder and finishes Aguilera with a [beautifully applied anaconda choke](https://www.instagram.com/tv/COoYBhXhi2d/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link).",Breakdown of the only submission on UFC on ESPN 24,13,1

After that, things have to play out roughly according to probability. 

How does that feasibly change MMA and combat sports history in some huge way that makes things look a lot different today? 

Here's my three favorite timelines:

1. Ken Shamrock heelhooks Royce Gracie at UFC 1. Nobody gives much of a fuck about the Gracie family or BJJ as a whole. Instead, leglocks are prevalent in MMA from the very beginning and Catch Wrestling is insanely popular. Today, Gordon Ryan is recognised as the greatest Catch Wrestler on the planet and Jiu-jitsu is just that thing that kinda looks like Judo.

2. Bas Rutten never experiences the multitude of injuries that see him retire in 1999. Instead, he follows his plan to drop down to LHW and takes on Frank Shamrock. Rutten crushes him for the third time and becomes the first champ champ in UFC history, before losing to Tito Ortiz and setting up the epic trilogy match with him where Rutten wins 2-1 and retires in the post-fight interview on top of the world.

3. Chael Sonnen never gets caught at the end of the Silva fight and wins by Decision. He successfully ducks the rematch with Silva and defends against Brian Stann and Bisping instead, delaying the Belfort fight until TRT is outlawed and beats old-man Belfort too. As Silva continues to beat Fighters his rematch is undeniable, so Sonnen retires instead and laughs all the way to the bank. To this day he refers to himself as the greatest Middleweight in MMA history.",Your favorite alternate timeline,529,1

Garbrandt was knocking people out left and right but then he got his ass handed the same way a couple times.  I get it, its a risky fight plan but just play along if you will and add some to the list. 

Dominck the dominator gets dominated by Cody,   
Weidman wins via TKO with that disturbing leg injury with anderson then he loses the same way.

People are proposing making harsher punishments like 50+% of their purse, automatic point deductions, etc. It seems almost unanimously agreed upon on this sub that fighters who miss weight have a significant advantage in the fight.

I was curious, so I did some searching and found this study from 2018 - https://www.mmafighting.com/platform/amp/2018/2/22/17037768/is-missing-weight-an-advantage-or-a-detriment-on-fight-night. 

They look at all fights in which one fighter missed weight since early weigh-in procedures were implemented in 2016, 42 bouts total. In those fights, those who missed weight went 23-19 (54%). They then looked at who was the betting favorite in these fights to try to control for expected outcome without the weight discrepancy and found underdogs missing weight went 7-14 (33.3%) in their 21 fights. By contrast, betting favorites who missed weight went 16-5 (76.2%) during that time.

In 2019, there were 30 fighters who missed weight. They went a combined 10-17-1, with two of the fights being canceled. 


I thought this was interesting and would surprise a lot of people here, as the general opinion seems to be that missing weight provides a huge advantage and fighters are even doing it intentionally, sacrificing the 30% of their purse to almost “guarantee” a win.  It turns out that coming in over the limit doesn’t seem to provide any advantage historically.",Fighters Intentionally Missing Weight To Gain An Advantage,63,1

Anecdotally, weight misses were pretty rare before COVID-19. I would guess that 2020 and 2021 make up 25-35% of the misses here. 

&amp;#x200B;

115, 125 (women's) and 135, 145, and 155 (men) are brutal cuts.

&amp;#x200B;

Surprisingly, men's 125 has the second least weight misses. 155 doesn't make up for the bulk of the misses which was kind of weird to me.

&amp;#x200B;

I also noticed that weight misses were pretty particular, it was not entirely random.  A few here and there but I saw the same names sprinkled through-out.

&amp;#x200B;

Last comment, I'm kinda disappointed that Greg Hardy didn't miss weight cause that would have been a hilarious meme.

Kevin Lee lost all his momentum after losing his next fight after the Gregor KO, but the guy he lost to was Charles fuckin Oliveira. The guy who is fighting for the lightweight title this weekend. Do Bronx has sense when on to completely shut down and dominate Tony Ferguson like never seen before. With hindsight it seems harsh that everyone has seemingly given up on Kevin Lee after losing to potentially the next lightweight champion, especially considering he put up a pretty good fight (way better than Tony at least) against Charles up until getting caught in the guillotine.

*Abstract: If nothing else, this weekend's UFC will feature chipped shoulders and hunger for MMA Glory.*

As anti-climactic and uncertain as Khabib Nurmagomedov's retirement was, his exit from the UFC has opened the door for some of the world's top Lightweight talent. As it swung open, Charles ""Do Bronx"" Oliviera had already been storming that door - finishing seven straight UFC opponents before finally crossing paths with ""El Cucuy"" Tony Ferguson. El Cucuy had snapped a (12-fight) win streak himself just months prior in a crowdless bout with Justin Gaethje. With the Oliviera-Ferguson fight came a dying hope for [the most sought after fight to never happen](https://www.bbc.com/sport/mixed-martial-arts/52129874#:~:text=The%20fight%20has%20been%20arranged,Ferguson%20developed%20a%20kidney%20problem.). [Ferguson survived one of the most gruesome arm bars you will ever see](https://youtu.be/kB4jgaYYBlI?t=300) in the very first round of that fight while the UFC's submission king ([14 UFC subs](http://statleaders.ufc.com/)) had his way to a unanimously scored 30-26 three round fight.  The performance earns Do Bronx a shot at the vacant Lightweight title against relative newcomer Michael Chandler this Saturday night as Ferguson settles for the #9 ranked Beneil Dariush in the co-main event [(previously Nate Diaz vs. Leon Edwards)](https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/bouts/562791-ufc-262-leon-rocky-edwards-vs-nate-diaz).

When Ferguson makes his 19th visit to the octagon Saturday, Dariush will be making his 20th, but in two and a half years less time. While Tony wears the #5 ranking in the division, the Assyrian-American Dariush (#9) carries a six fight win streak - claiming four of those victories since his opponent has managed one. Tony is undefeated for over nine years in fights with fans in the seats though, and has another opportunity to prove [how well he channels the chaos of a crowd](https://twitter.com/MacMallyMMA/status/1391935706205880323) against Dariush. Between their recently polarizing fight outcomes, notable gaps in competition, and fight finishing versatility, there are a wide range of outcomes to prepare for in this Lightweight clash.

Former Bellator champion ""Iron"" Michael Chandler managed a quick finish over Dan ""The Hangman"" Hooker at UFC 257 this past January. Those 150 seconds make up the entirety of the 35 year old's UFC career, whereas his opponent this Saturday, Charles Oliviera has been in the promotion since he was 20. Do Bronx, now 31, has accumulated an 18-8 UFC record (30-8 MMA) over those 10+ years and appears to be coming into his prime. Chandler (22-5 MMA) had a storied Bellator career, toting 11 title fights, winning six of them, and going undefeated in non-title bouts. He defeated ""The Underground King"" Eddie Alvarez to attain gold for the first time in [one of the greatest Lightweight fights of all time](https://www.tapology.com/rankings/all-time-top-ten-best-lightweight-mma-fights-155-pounds) just under 10 years ago. Now, he's being given an opportunity at the undisputed UFC championship before either of his UFC 262 Postermates. Although[ Ferguson was *scheduled* for such an opportunity once before](https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/bouts/470020-ufc-249-khabib-the-eagle-nurmagomedov-vs-tony-el-cucuy-ferguson), the fight never took place. Worth noting is the fact that Chandler has never been submitted, but faces the man with [27% more submission victories than *anyone*](http://statleaders.ufc.com/) in UFC history.

All three fight cards will feature a Women's Flyweight fight May 15th: Katlyn Chookagian (#2), Viviane Araujo (#7), Andrea Lee (#11), and Antonina Shevchenko (#12) all do so as ranked UFC contenders.

Lee and Shevchenko will meet on the prelims. Andrea ""KGB"" Lee entered the UFC with an 8-2 record just short of three years ago, recording a three fight win streak until conflicting scorecards led to consecutive split decision losses and finally, a unanimous decision loss to Roxanne ""The Happy Warrior"" Modafferi. Roxanne also delivered Lee her first professional loss back in 2014 at Invicta FC 10. ""KGB"" looks to bounce back to her winning ways, but will see plenty of obstacles in Antonina ""La Pantera"" Shevchenko. Antonina, elder sister of flyweight champion Valentina, took 12 years off of MMA between 2005 and 2017, but has kept busy since then, amassing an impressive 7-2 record (3-2 UFC). ""La Pantera"" has flip flopped wins and losses since her promotional debut at the TUF 28 Finale against Ji Yeon Kim. Most recently, she finished ""The Queen of Violence"" Ariane Lipski in round 2 at UFC 255. Whether it's Lee or Shevchenko getting their hand raised, the winner will likely crack top ten status in the UFC. 

Katlyn ""Blonde Fighter"" Chookagian and ""Vivi"" Arajuo both hold top ten rankings, #2 and #7 respectfully, and both carry December losses to Jessica Eye (consecutive years - '18, '19). Chookagian has attained a 4-2 record since then and even challenged Flyweight Queen Valentina ""Bullet"" Shevchenko for her belt last February. Arajuo holds unanimous decision wins over both of her opponents since facing Eye, working her way up in the flyweight rankings with a [70% career finish rate](https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/106437-viviane-araujo-vivi). Chookagian on the other hand ([20% career finish rate](https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/37760-katlyn-chookagian)), has yet to finish a single UFC opponent, while still managing 8 decision wins (7 unanimous). The cage will close behind them prior to the Ferguson-Dariush contest.

Capping off the prelims is a familiar face to fight fans: Ronaldo ""Jacare"" Souza. The former Strikeforce Middleweight Champion will face Andre ""Sergipano"" Muniz, a winner of 14 of his last 15 fights (4-0 UFC, DWCS). The 31 year old Muniz is on a six fight win streak and will face the 41 year old on a three fight losing streak. Jacare will make his way to the UFC octagon for the 16th time with eyes set on ending both streaks and as of this writing, [there is no betting favorite/underdog](https://www.bestfightodds.com/events/ufc-262-oliveira-vs-chandler-2086).

[UFC 262](https://www.ufc.com/event/ufc-262) is slated for 12 total fights this Saturday, May 15th.

I was kinda shocked how much the price of tickets were, but I assume with the state of the world it's gonna sell out regardless. Especially when you have two title fights and the return of Nate Diaz....

Predictions:

Adesanya/Vettori: I'm super torn on this one. Smart money is on Izzy, and I want him to win so Rob gets his title shot, but I just have a nasty feeling Marvin is gonna grind out a decision and we'll end up seeing a rematch. 

Marvin via UD

Figuereido/Moreno: And Still. Point deduction aside, the champ was clearly the better fighter in their first match, and he was nowhere near 100%. I think we see a better, more dominant performance. 

Figuereido by TKO round 4.

Edwards/Diaz: I'm gonna get alot of hate for this one, as Leon is clearly the smart pick. But Nate's gonna do something spectacular. His durability and pressure will get to Leon late in the fight.

Diaz by sub round 4

Maia/Muhammed: Ahh, how nice would it be to see Demian Maia pull off a submission? That would make me so happy but Muhammed is in the perfect headspace right now and will grind this one out. He's too much for a clearly past his prime Maia

Muhammed by UD

Craig/Hill: One of my good buds is close friends with Hill so I'm a little biased here, but he's the clear favorite anyways. Hell be too much for Craig. This is gonna be a statement to open the main card.

Hill by TKO round 2",[UFC 263] Discussion,17,1

He has many strengths, which he knows how to use, and few weaknesses.  He has powerful, precise hands, excellent footwork and movement, a ridiculous pace, and crafty dual-threat wrestling.  He can close the distance with immense speed, and get out of danger just as quickly.  He is experienced, and often pulls away from his opponents in championship rounds.

If I were designing an opponent for Chandler with the intent to defeat him, that opponent would need to be tough, fast, and have good cardio to keep pace.  That opponent would need to have good range management and strong distanced attacks, to hurt Chandler from the outside.  That opponent would need to be strong on the ground as a counter to Chandler’s wrestling, and to liberate them from the fear of the takedown.  That opponent would need to match Chandler’s unpredictability in the striking.  That opponent would need to be a crafty veteran who’s seen it all.  Lastly, that opponent would need to be a clinical finisher to keep Chandler from ever getting his second wind.

Stop me if this description sounds familiar.  To me, it sounds exactly like Charles “Do Bronx” Oliveira.

Chandler’s greatest struggles in his career have been against fighters who can match or outclass him on the ground, and he has never been outclassed quite like he is against Charlie Olives.  Oliveira thrives on the mat, putting together masterclasses of grappling and setting records.  In my mind, his pedigree removes the fear of the takedown which serves as one of Chandler’s greatest striking weapons.  A level change is meaningless when it will immediately be met by the sharpest guillotine choke in the business.  A double leg takedown is pointless if your opponent is so willing to go to ground that they will pull guard to get there.  Chandler’s striking, without his level changes, is rather one-dimensional.

The one dimension remaining for Chandler is his dynamic ability to close the distance.  He darts in and out with great speed, a wide stance, and a low center of gravity.  But Oliveira has precise distance control.  His long straight punches, teep kicks, and forward pressure compose an ideal recipe for neutralizing Chandler’s speed and spacing.

To my untrained eyes, Michael Chandler’s only path to victory is to starch Charles Oliveira or win a close decision.  Charlie Olives is not immune to being TKOd, but it hasn’t happened since Paul Felder did it from guard four years ago.  Meanwhile, every other path to victory remains open for Oliveira: knockout, submission, decision, and doctor stoppage are all in the realm of possibility for the versatile Brazilian.  With his veteran experience, surging hot streak, and striking that gets better with every outing, I like the chances of “Do Bronx” to get it done against an older opponent for whom he is a nightmare matchup.

I foresee Chandler’s aggression giving him the edge in round one.  In round two, when he goes for a takedown, Oliveira nearly submits him with a guillotine to steal the round.  In round 3, Charles is the aggressor, mixing up his striking with takedown attempts to out-point Chandler and keep him at range.  The fourth round is more competitive until Oliveira nails “Iron” with a nasty knee.  Charlie Olives immediately takes the back and works his way to a triangle armbar using clean and clinical passes.

Prediction: Oliveira by 4th round submission.",A case for Charlie Olives,156,1

60,nby164,https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/nby164/ufc_legacy_division/,brownbilal,2021-05-14 02:19:35,MMA,"Just a thought that popped in my head after Cowboy's loss this past weekend. Would it be in the interest of the UFC to create (but not really create) a legacy division/bracket of fighters with name value but who are coming towards the end of their careers?   


Thinking is, it would still preserve some charm for these fighters rather than have these boys be merked by up and coming fighters. Also, good name fights to put up as co-main events or main card fights. The weight would probably be 170 with most of these fighters around that weight.   


I doubt this would ever happen, tbh, because of how the fighting world works. Newer, hungrier, better up and comers take the place of the older, slower veterans and so is the cycle of the fight game. But here is food for thought. 

Possible Fighter Lineup:   
1) **Nate Diaz** \- Surprisingly booked against probable title contender in a really one-sided affair, Nate seems to be at a position where the top 10 of LW and WW might be too much for him. With a Conor trilogy and BMF rematch possibly in the future, no other big fights seem to be on the horizon for Nate.   
2) **Nick Diaz** \- Away from the fight game for 5 years, the game might have flew past him. Unsure of where he stands, it would be unfortunate to see him comeback and get mauled by a WW which would most likely end a storied career. Why not pitch him with some other legend of the game and see where he stands?   
3) **Jorge Masvidal** \- With a 0-2 record against the champ who looks to reign for a long time, and many difficult fights in the division, it might be smart for Jorge to look elsewhere? Top 10 WW matchups where Jorge is the favorite, are hard to find. Jorge has created a huge name for himself, where a loss or two more, would make it extremely difficult for him moving forwards. Instead of devaluing the name and possibly losing out on a bunch of fantastic money-laden matchups, why not put him up against some big names and continue the legend of Gamebred?  
4) **Tony Ferguson** \- Contingent on this weekends performance, ofcourse. The legend of El Cucuy is still alive but with a leg in its grave. At the age of 37, even though he said he hasn't hit his prime yet, people think Tony might be past it. With a formidable opponent in Benny Dariush in front of him, this could be a real test of where Tony stands in the division and where his career trajectory might be heading. If the UFC's very own Chief Security Officer was to lose this upcoming fight, bouts against Nick Diaz, Jorge Masvidal at 170 might be of interest rather than having the man be a punching bag for upcoming LWs.   
5) **Robbie Lawler** \- 39, 1-5 in his last 6, still around in good shape. Has been repeatedly fed to up and comers, and has always been game for it. Still a household name, atleast for the diehards, maybe a fight against Nate, Nick, Condit could be put up as a co-main for a FN or a main card fight for a PPV?   
6) **Carlos Condit** \- Winner of his last two bouts after snapping a 5 fight losing streak, looking OK in his last fight, 37 year old NBK might not have what it takes to surge the rankings for a title run. Instead of having him fight a top 20 WW, one of these legacy fights, maybe Cowboy, wouldn't be bad?  
7) **Donald Cerrone** \- Onto Cowboy... Dana said 1 more fight at 155. Don't think he has it in him to contend anymore. Like he said, mentally he's there but physically, not so much. Still a household name, still profitable for the UFC, still a company man. Fights against Condit, Lawler, Nick, Nate could still be LIT.  
8) **Matt Brown** \- 40, coming of a loss to Condit and heading into a fight against Dhiego Lima, the Immortal has been looking pretty damn mortal these days. A legend of the game, rematches against Lawler, Maia, Cerrone could be on the table... Idk I think he should retire but put him here to fill the numbers.   
9) **Paul Felder** \- An incredible physique, an amazing beard, a knack of throwing spinning shit, capped with a theatre degree and a job in the booth, Paul has stuck around too long in the top 15. With a desire to only fight exciting big names and his constant flirting with retirement, the Irish Dragon is still fun to watch. With back to back FoTN awards and difficulty making 155, a couple legacy fights at 170 could do the trick for Felder.   
10) **Rafa dos Anjos** \- Contingent on his next LW bout. Seemed to look good against a 5 day notice Felder, RDA wants to mount a run at LW. #7 currently at LW, with a possible contenders fight coming up, if RDA was to lose, it would be safe to say that he could be fed to the likes of Islam, Gregor, Tsarukyan to test their championship aspirations. Too small for the big dogs at 170, this could be his last run for UFC gold. 36, not getting any younger, could be some good fights for the man against the fellow legacy fighters.   
11) **Demian Maia** \- if the WW God of BJJ does not want to retire, maybe some legacy fights might be of interest to him? Currently booked against Belal Muhammad which seems like a ""take my spot, young lion fight"" a loss here could call an end for his career. 43, but a 3-1 in the last four, he might have what it takes to do a couple more of these legacy fights.   
12) **Conor McGregor** \- Hear me out, I know he is still in the prime of his career, I understand. But what we need to realize is that Conor is at a real crossroads. A casualty of his own name, but let me explain. At the level of stardom Conor is at, another couple of losses could be detrimental for his career not only inside but also outside the cage. Heck, even a loss to Dustin in the re-rematch trilogy fight might put some doubt in Conor's head. Does he want to contend again in the LW sharktank with matchups against Gaethje, Islam, Oliveira, Chandler, coming up where on paper, you might think he has a solid chance, but so he did against DP in Jan. Unlike many other fighters, Conor now (after losses to Khabib and Dustin) does not have the ability to take a few more losses and still have the unbeaten persona that he has that is so lucrative for him. If he wins against Dustin, scratch him of this list, but if he doesn't, maybe a few fights against Jorge, Nate, Nick might be something he might want to look at?

Honorable Less-Elite Mentions for Less-Elite Bouts:   
1) Clay Guida - yeah, i dont think i need to say much here.  
2) Jeremy Stephens - i think he is supposed to fight at 155 next and a bout is booked, but wouldn't mind him at 170 jus swanging and banging with the less elite legacy boys  
3) Joe Lauzon (retired?) - i think he is still looking for a retirement fight, might be wrong.   
4) Frank Camacho - meh, just threw him in here.   
5) Michael Johnson - boy got hands, that is all.   
6) Bobby Green - great character, great persona, still fights like a fucking gangster.   
7) Killer Cub Swanson - needs a legacy fight to retire imo but he is at 145.",UFC Legacy Division,32,1

So, I sought out a coach who had some unusual methods that were to help me with tolerating pain.

We did the normal stuff, hardening via repeated contact, meditation &amp; mindfulness exercises, but last weekend he did something I had NEVER heard of and put me extremely outside my comfort zone. I trust this coach, he’s become a good friend of mine in the last couple months, so I don’t want to end that friendship over something that only I perceive as weird.


He had me strip down and started slapping my testicles with a flyswatter. Slowly, he started building up to a higher and higher intensity, then switched to a rolled up magazine. At this point I was on the verge of throwing up and had to take a break and begged him to stop as I was writhing in pain on the floor.

We ended that session but he wants to make this a once a month thing and I’m honestly afraid of any potential side effects of this. Also I want to make 100% clear there is nothing homosexual going on (I’m straight and in a happy relationship!).

For example, some fighters staying in the rankings when they clearly should not be ranked anymore. Or some fighters who clearly should get a fight against a ranked guy not getting the chance to for a long time. I was thinking of how we would be able to solve some of the problems and I came up with a system that might help in some situations (probably not new, but I haven't seen it exactly like this). Obviously, this wouldn't really be implemented because of money reasons, but I was just wondering if this seems fair enough from just a competition standpoint.

**Movement Within Top 15**

First off, to fight for the title you have to be in the top 5. The only exception is a late notice replacement. If you lose a title fight you go down to 10th place in the rankings if you were above 10, or stay where you are if you were below 10. This is regardless if you were defending the title or trying to be a new champion.

* I think this would help in keeping the division fresh from repeated rematches so soon. It also helps fighters prove they deserve another title shot by having to climb from position 10 (how to climb in a bit).

* Generally the highest rank would fight for a title, but there are scenarios where that might not happen. This could be cause of injuries or a huge win streak from someone else in the top 5 might make that fighter more deserving.

For general fights within the top 15, a decision win means you go up two positions. A finish means you go up three positions. In the scenario that you were 10th in the rankings. That would mean that you would need a finish (3 spots) and a decision (2 spots) to make the top five and have a chance to fight for another title shot. Note that you might have to win more though as the fighters above might be more deserving of a title shot.

A loss would mean you go down two spots in a decision, or you go down three spots if you were finished. 

**Movement Into and Out of the Top 15**

Anyone who has lost and gone to position 15 is no longer ranked and HAS to fight for the 15th spot against an unranked fighter.

* This helps keep the rankings fresh and gives unranked fighters a clear avenue of getting into rankings.

For finding unranked fighters that deserve the ranked fight you would use the sum of the points they would get from their last three fights in the UFC. So if someone has three finishes they would have nine points (if you use what they would get in the rankings as points). Three decisions would be six points. So the nine point fighter would fight for the spot.

* This hopefully would stop fighters with ludicrous win streaks from getting shafted.

**Decay**

If you haven't fought for 8 months, you go down one position. After that, every 4 months is another two positions. If you've decayed into the 15th position you either defend your spot or you're out and the top unranked contenders fight for the spot.

* This is self explanatory and punishes your rank if you don't fight. Kinda sucks for those that are injured, but I think it's fair considering you know how to climb back up.
* I use 8 months just because I'm thinking a fighter should probably fight twice a year if they're healthy.

**Win Streaks**

Something else that might help a fighter with huge win streaks is to award another point/ranking for every three fight win streak for a maximum of five points/rankings for a finish and 4 points/rankings for a decision.

* I think this would help fighters who aren't really finishers, but they keep winning.

Hopefully I got everything, but that's my take. Do you all see anything to improve it?",How do you all feel about this type of ranking system in the UFC?,22,1

Giagos counters by sprawling his hips and going to a front head and a quick transition into a D'arce grip. Darce locks the figure four near the neck. He glues his ear to the back of Soriano to give length from the arm to thread through from the arm side and locks a darce. He tries to break down Soriano and captures the near leg. Soriano could have easily countered this by kicking the leg free with free leg to clear any leg grips and try to expand his trapped elbow to begin escaping the darce but it was already quite tight. 

**Lee's Triangle Armbar** **on Shevchenko** \- Lee had a perpendicular angle on Shevchenko but the bend of her knee was directly in front of one of the carotid arteries. That combined with her leg over the line of the shoulders were also at an off angle which gave too much space to the trapped shoulder. That trapped shoulder is supposed to be covered by the figure four. These two reasons are why the triangle, among good defence on putting her trapped elbow in either sides of the hip of Lee allowed her to evade the triangle. However, Lee intelligently takes a modified lat grip on the trapped arm and hyperextended it by bumping her hips. 

**Muniz' Armbar** **on Jacare** \- Holy shit. OK, Muniz shoots a double and his head is on the opposite side that is common for right handed double legs (was on Jacare's left hip). This was due to Jacare coming off a kick and blading his stance. His weight on his heel so he was taken down in a linear fashion easily. Jacare attempted to use a butterfly hook to create space and technical standup but there was not enough space and exposed his back and ended up in a rear bodylock.

Here, Jacare went a four point. Muniz threw a deep near hook in (which was the appropriate response). and Jacare tried to throw him off but Muniz was able to stay glued due to the deep near hook. Jacare kept an arm near a hip of Muniz who transitioned into a quasi attempted triangle and secured a lat grip on the arm and broke him. Unable to tell if the arm was broken at the tricep tendon, bicep tendon, or even possibly a dislocated shoulder.",All the Submission Wins from UFC 262,13,1

Olivera finishes chandler and we both just start yellin.

&amp;#x200B;

But the fight with Barboza Vs Burgos IMO was the cherry on top (No hate over here i've just been a fan of Barboza since way back)

The kicks, counters and tenacity was FENOMENAL, i cant stress this enough but after every kick we both just screamed at how beautiful those kicks are. Barboza makes it look like on motion and gives no time to react.

The ending was VERY unexpected and i think i speak for us all, that delayed KO was a sight to be seen.

Crazy night of random stuff happening at UFC 262. Grats to Charles Olivera, the new LW champ. I thought Chandler had him at the end of round 1, just like most everybody else who was watching it. Pfft. Noper! Unreal early blast from the new Champ in round 2. Killer stuff. Chandler has proven that he really is a dangerous guy, so we'll see some great fights out of him I am sure. Personally, I want to see a rematch with Dan Hooker, but Mike has tons of people in that murders row of a division to match up with. What about Justin Gaethje/Mike Chandler? That might be a fuckin banger.

I'm not sure if I want to see Tony Ferguson ever fight again, which fuckin sucks since he's entertaining as all hell, and used to be top 5(some would argue top 3) LW of all time. What was the stat thrown out last night at the after presser? In the last 30 minutes of Octagon time, Tony Ferguson has thrown a total of 30 strikes. Not exactly the output of a fighter looking to take out Porier, McGregor, Justin Gaethje(who destroyed Tony first), Chandler, and of course, Olivera (who destroyed Tony the last time). Combine this with 3 in a row where all Tony does is get injured. Not cool. I don't watch the sport to watch injuries. This isn't Nascar ya fuckin redneck fucks! (lol)

Speaking of bad injuries, Jacare had his arm broken last night, yikes! It was tough to even clearly see it happen, which is ok. After Weidman, I don't need to see bones break, ya know?. Hope he's ok, but he's another one who needs to retire, I think. Legends in sports need to retire before they are pale shadows of themselves. Hey, Khabib may actually be the smartest fuckin guy of all time(oh, GSP is another). Get out while nobody can touch you, before your style doesn't work as well anymore and age catches your currently invincible ass.

Antonina got smoked again, and that really depressed me. For the first half of round 1, it was the fight I wanted to see. Valentina yelling HEY from the corner every time Nina lands, always makes me laugh. I love these two. Then she spends the rest of the fight on her back not getting anything done. After her last performance, where it looked like she did a leap 4 times over on her ground game, last night she looked like a fish out of water again. For surviving nearly 4 minutes in a triangle choke without tapping, Nina get's my ""Honorary Tough as Fuck Michael Bisping/Tony Ferguson Award"". Still, though, it was a roll, and that sucked. As soon as Valentina can't yell HEY anymore, you already know Nina is going to lose. Well, time for that professional upcoming pilot's license to come in handy, girl.

Now for... ""That's a first"". Watch ""Any Given Sunday"" for a few minutes, in the beginning, when Jamie Foxx just gets on the field and then pukes. Al Pacino, pauses, and then deadpan and in pure monotone goes... ""That's a first"". 📷 Barbosa/Burgos. What a banger, but then... this happens... That's a fuckin first.

I was watching some combat Sambo last night &amp; got thinking that the answer may be yes. 
I figured BJJ is often considered the most important martial art in MMA as it allows you to get control on the ground, but it teaches no striking or stand up fighting 
Combat Sambo on the other hand teaches you the wrestling &amp; grappling part of dport Sambo plus stand up fighting &amp; striking.

I’m 5’5”, 172, never once set foot in a serious fighting gym, and I’m obsessed with MMA. I’m obsessed with the entire concept of fighting, with physical prowess, and genuine artistry when it comes to mixed martial arts. Sure I have career ambitions outside of the concept, but I’m at the current state where I cannot tackle those ambitions. I wanna get into it, I wanna push my body to the farthest reaches it’ll allow, I wanna take the physical and mental risks, I wanna put the years in, I wanna get my ass beat, I wanna feel the thrill of a victory no matter how big or small, I wanna one day hit circuits and fight at least one fight before I die. Don’t care what the fuck happens, just stepping into an octagon with another fighter and seeing him on the other side knowing he wants this just as bad as I do would make it all more than worth it. 

It’s one of those things that’s a dream I wish I tackled before now, but the time is right. In my town there is a reportedly and reputedly wonderful UFC Gym (Reno, NV). I’m a big fan of Boxing, so I’m maybe considering tackling that first (if I even can or if that even makes sense to do)

I have no idea what I’m doing so please be as brutally honest as you can. What should I seriously take in consideration (financially, physically, etc.)?

But Houston was also where we just witnessed some fantastic fights, revealing some new top contenders at 145, and 155, as well as the main goal for UFC 262: crown a new lightweight champion. Here are some fights to make after UFC 262.

Quick Rounds

Andrea Lee: Loser of Maia-Eye

Katlyn Chookagian: Winner of Maia-Eye

Viviane Araujo: Cynthia Calvillo

Jordan Wright: Jun Yong Park

Andre Muniz: Brendan Allen or Kevin Holland

&amp;#x200B;

Big Breakdowns

&amp;#x200B;

* Shane Burgos vs. Edson Barboza

RESULT: Edson Barboza defeats Shane Burgos in Round 3 via TKO (punch)

Edson Barboza: Calvin Kattar or Zabit Magomedsharipov

EJB has reintroduced himself to the elite levels of MMA, by entering the top 10 of the featherweight division with his electrifying win over Shane Burgos, which stole the night until the main event happened. With Edson's newest found spark in MMA, perhaps it's now appropriate to really push him to the top of the 145 food chain. A fight with Calvin Kattar, or Zabit Magomedsharipov should headline a fight night, and either one is stylistically heaven. Target this fight for September 25th on the same card as Santos-Walker. Now that's a banger baby.

&amp;#x200B;

Before I get into the lightweight fights, here are my new rankings for the lightweight division.

(C) Charles Oliveira

\#1 Dustin Poirier

\#2 Justin Gaethje

\#3 Beneil Dariush

\#4 Conor McGregor

\#5 Michael Chandler

\#6 Rafael Dos Anjos

\#7 Tony Ferguson

\#8 Dan Hooker

\#9 Paul Felder

\#10 Islam Makhachev

\#11 Gregor Gillespie

\#12 Kevin Lee

\#13 Diego Ferreira

\#14 Drew Dober

\#15 Thiago Moises

\- Beneil Dariush's win streak has hit 7, he's deserving of a spot in the top 3.

\- Since he's fighting Islam in July, I figured that Thiago Moises was at least deserving of a number next to his name ahead of this big fight.

&amp;#x200B;

* Tony Ferguson vs. Beneil Dariush

RESULT: Beneil Dariush defeats Tony Ferguson via unanimous decision

&amp;#x200B;

Beneil Dariush: Justin Gaethje

Another big name from Kings MMA has emerged. Beneil Dariush has extended his win streak to seven, and yesterday he got his biggest win of his career over Tony Ferguson. Dariush might be one more fight away from a title shot, and with that considered, he needs a bigger opponent for that title shot to potentially happen. Justin Gaethje is there. Gaethje of course last fought for the title against former champion Khabib Nurmagomedov last October. Gaethje lost the title via submission, and despite him wanting to get back into the octagon just 8 weeks after that loss, it's now been nearly 7 months since The Highlight last fought. Gaethje-Dariush is a perfect title eliminator fight to make for sometime in August.

&amp;#x200B;

Tony Ferguson: Donald Cerrone II

The days of El Cucuy are officially behind us. Tony Ferguson has lost his last 11 rounds, and it's not been close. At this point the UFC is contemplating whether or not Ferguson will be flat out cut from the promotion. At 37 years of age, and on a nasty 3 fight losing skid, Ferguson's days are very limited. Not to mention, I just can't comprehend the gameplans that he brings. When he needs to get the fight to the ground against Gaethje he didn't, and when he had to stand up against Dariush, he didn't. He stayed on his back for 12 minutes in a 15 minute fight where his career was in a do or die situation. Tony is not going to get a title shot, and in no fucking universe is he fighting Khabib at this point in his career, so neither he, or his fans should be holding their breath for the Russian to return and fight him. Luckily, I think I found the next move for Ferguson on this losing skid: fight a fellow legendary fighter on an even bigger losing skid. Yes, my suggestion is for Tony Ferguson and Donald Cerrone to run it back. Legend v Legend. El Cucuy vs Cowboy. UFC Fight Night Main Event. Book it for the Fall of 2021, as a send off for both of these future hall of famers.

&amp;#x200B;

* Charles Oliveira vs. Michael Chandler

RESULT: Charles Oliveira defeats Michael Chandler in Round 2 via TKO.

&amp;#x200B;

Charles Oliveira: Winner of Poirier-McGregor III

It took him over 10 years, but Charles Oliveira finally did it. UFC fans have seen the Brazilian grow for 1/3 of his entire life. Developing from a 20 year old prospect flooded with promising attributes, to an elite member of the MMA world, and becoming the best lightweight on the planet at 31 years of age. It's been 10 damn years and Charles Oliveira has really hit his prime. This is like Jan Blachowicz' resurgence but maybe even better. We could see Oliveira at the top of the division for several years to come. With great work comes even greater reward, and if the cards play out in Oliveira's favor, then Brazil's newest champion could be in store for highly pursued red panty night. The winner of Dustin Poirier-Conor McGregor III will most definitely get the shot at the world title barring any controversy, or serious injury in the bout. In the eyes of some, the champ status of Oliveira can still be debated, especially with Dustin Poirier sitting at the top of the contender rankings. Oliveira-Poirier or Oliveira-McGregor will be booked likely in November or December. Put it at the Raiders Stadium in Vegas, or Abu Dhabi, along with Jorge Masvidal vs. Nick Diaz and you've got a minimum of 1 million PPV buys, and perhaps even 2 million if McGregor wins this July. The golden age of the lightweight division is really picking things up for 2021.

&amp;#x200B;

Michael Chandler: Rafael Dos Anjos or Dustin Poirier

Life changes quick, especially in a cage fight. After putting a hurting on Charles Oliveira in Round 1, Michael Chandler got too comfortable with his guard, and got caught by a beautifully placed left hook by Charlie Olives which ended the main event just 19 seconds into Round 2. If Chandler had won last night, he would have been the 2nd quickest champion to go from debuting to winning the world title, just two days behind Anderson Silva when he did it by winning the middleweight title in the 2000s. Michael Chandler's pursuit for UFC gold is not over. Chandler can track himself back to the title a lot quicker with a fight against Justin Gaethje, which I do like, but like I stated before, I think that Dariush deserves a fight with Gaethje instead. Personally, I would like for Michael Chandler to face Rafael Dos Anjos in a fight night main event. This is especially the case if Dustin beats Conor in July. I just can't picture Chandler-McGregor happening for some reason. However, if Dustin loses this July, Poirier-Chandler is a tremendous fight to make, for the sake of both men. book those two to fight 5 rounds in a big fight night main event. If things go right for Chandler, then he could get a quicker track back to fighting for the title, perhaps within the next 18 months.

&amp;#x200B;

Charles Oliveira: ""I asked that a lot, I talked a lot with Macaco that I wanted to go back to featherweight, but... I don't want it anymore. I am a flyweight. Truly. And not only because I'm a champion today. But if they gave me the opportunity to fight for the belt, with time I would go down. If Dana White gave me the opportunity to fight directly for the featherweight belt. I'll go down.""

Original video from the interview: [Here (his post-fight press conference)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZDLk-G6M8U).

Translation: ""Me and Macaco talk a lot about this an I still feel like a featherweight, you know? But I kind... in this division(?). But if Dana White gave me the opportunity to go back there in the featherweight division and win, I take it.""

&amp;#x200B;

Catch any difference there? Well. Apart from the usual toning down that's always present with this guy's translations... The important part here is: he literally said Charles felt like a featherweight. Which he never said. EVER. He, in fact, said the opposite. He said he is effectively and by all means a real flyweight and made it very clear. This guy just invented facts out of air. This shit is now on [MMA On Point](https://www.instagram.com/p/CO8kwagMmUi/) and I'm sure in many other outlets. The public view right now is that he wants to go back to featherweight, because he feels like one. Which is just false. He said he ONLY would go down if it was for the belt, but other than that, he will forever be a flyweight and that's where he feels better. 

&amp;#x200B;

Seriously, stop saying this guy is a good translator. I know he speaks good english and looks like a good bloke from england who would drink a beer with you. But I'm being honest when I say he's just AWFUL. This is only one of his many mistakes this weekend. You might have seen me around here commenting about this, and I even used this example: [Click here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MMA/comments/nbqlzq/official_ufc_262_press_conference_discussion/gy1980t/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

Other guys in the youtube comments of his other interview (of course, also from Brazil), also share my opinion about the same issues with his translations (especially in Charles' case).

&amp;#x200B;

Some people say it's a hard job, and remembering everything isn't that plausible, and that Charles talks very fast and etc... I present to you just one example of a good translator (there's definitely more out there), that asian guy who translated, if I'm not mistaken, last week. THAT guy is good. He is a proper interpreter. If your answer has 5 sentences, he will translate the 5 sentences, not just summarize it in 1 or 2, with less interesting wordings like this guy. 

&amp;#x200B;

The idea came up when Joe Rogan stated that Oliveira was the ""number 1 submission guy in the history of the UFC"" which begs the question as to what he meant by that. Off hand I think in terms of stats Oliveira is indeed number 1 for most total submissions, though in my mind that doesn't make him the greatest submission practitioner in MMA as it doesn't take into account total number of fights nor how many times they themselves have been submitted. Does anyone know who has the most submissions in MMA without ever having been submitted themselves? What about who has the highest percentage of wins by submission without ever having been submitted themsevles? The answer(s) to those questions will likely reveal a more accurate answer to the question of who reigns supreme in regard to being king of the submission hill.

That event happened in 2016, which featured the likes of Cain Velasquez, Brock Lesnar, Mark Hunt, Travis Browne, Meisha Tate, DC, Aldo, Edgar etc..

The majority of which are retired from fighting now, or in other organisations. Crazy how things change.

So UFC 300 will probably happen within the next 5 years (probably less with the pace they are pushing out numbered events recently).

What are your predictions for who will be champ in each division? Most likely all your favourite current fighters will be gone, or on their final run. Its likely a current no name, prospect or up and comer will be contender or champ. It will be a new era. I wouldn't be surprised if the brand itself has an overhaul.. new media members, new commentators, who knows how long Dana will stay working (he's getting up there in age now, but I still think he'll be there till the end).

A while ago during her interview with Joe Rogan - he asked about longer term plans and Rose said that she is going to retire when she is 30 years old.  I'll provide some timestamps for people who are interested in details. She also did mention that plans do change and you need to adapt and she didn't discount the possibility of her changing her mind and carrying on the fighting. However I didn't find anyone asking her about longer term plans again - it is usually what are you going to do (fight) next  - and the answer is usually I have a lot of options and just sorting out what to do. Retiring is also one of the options.


It also gives different perspective to the Dana's White statements that Rose Namajunas does not want to fight Weili Zhang. Why promote a person who is about to retire anyway... Also her almost ending her  MMA carrier after getting champion belt and all that extra attention and loss to Andrade.  


She is also quite big on setting personal example - so in some quite weird way, her quitting and starting a family at the height of the carrier would be quite an example to set and to remind everybody that there's time for everything. 


I really do hope someone asking about her longer term/retirement plans to clarify her current stance. 


With her current fight record - she fights like 1 fight per year, and stretching on her promise it is like 13-25 months left until she retires, I see at most 4 fights with Rose until she retires.


My personal dream she would have the following fights before her retirement:


Winner of: Yan Xiaonan vs Carla Esparza

Winner of: Zhang Weili vs Joanna Jędrzejczyk

Winner of: Mackenzie Dern vs Michelle Waterson

Retirement fight vs Valentina Shevchenko. 


If she is really about to retire - what are the matches you would like to see? 



======================
The timestamps and approximate stuff which were said during interview I'm basing this on. I've used interview timestamps for joe rogan interview on mixcloud - RJE MMA show #13
=====================



1:09:15

Joe Rogan: Now when you look at your future and you say ""I'm the champion now"" . do you have a roadmap what you have? Like I want to retire in 10 years, I wanna  get this, I wanna accomplish these things. Do you have anything like that? 

Rose Namajunas: Yeah, I like to have a plan. And things change, you know, and that is fine. You have to be able to adapt. I plan on not fighting longer than 5 years from now. 

JR: Really?
RN: Yeah.
JR: How old are you now? 
RN: 25
JR: So 30, that's where you out? 
RN: Yeah

She also admits that she might change her mind.

1:28:24

RN: You just have to have good purpose behind you are doing. Bottom line, whatever you wanna do, you can do it anything you want to do. &lt;...&gt;  is reasoning why you want to do it. &lt; ... &gt; 
JR: Right..
RN: And for me at this point is to change the world. I know it's a little frikking  
JR: Your reasoning is to change the world? 
RN: Yeah
JR: Really?
RN: Yeah 
JR: How so? 
RN: This is my best skill and the thing I can do the best and I think it reaches  big audience and I get my message across. And, like you were saying, just setting a better example, trying to, uhmm, the way people think or at least offering the difference perspective. You all gotta think like me 

JR: This is an active idea in your head while you are training, while you are doing media, you are thinking ""I have a chance to change the world"" 
RN: Yea, I wanna build a urban farm

Rose continues on examples how to change the world  building farm (explaining reasoning)

Obviously you’ll always have the hotheads but seeing fighters in the biggest fights of their lives show complete respect and admiration for their opponents with so many people watching is in my opinion the best way to continue growing this sport. 

The stigma of this just being human cockfighting and a blood sport is such an insane level of disrespect to the types of athletes these people are and how much it’s grown in 15 years. It is naturally intriguing to people when they see how human and relatable these people can be when they aren’t in a cage fight with the world watching.

There aren't many elite fighters i can think of that succeed without a team. As in, bodies to train with around a structured team ethic, where you are just a cog and the group is the main thing. T ferg has been running his own camp basically without a head coach also which is a problem. Conor used to train as a team now runs his own camp, although he ha other distractions. I have to feel this is a factor, the extent to which it is is undetermined. T wood was running his own things and had some success but tried to switch it up. Francis used to train without a team and now he fits in to the team in Las Vegas. I think we will see the team model dominate again like it did in the old days. Stipe has a cohesive team despite it being built around him, they did used to have Jessica eye too (lol.).Just food for thought.  Despite it being one on one, Whitman sends his guys to spar at team elevation and his fighters encourage each other, Rose Gaethje and Usman. I guess Max?

Even with his unbelievable back story, I just didn't think he had the heart to overcome adversity in the cage.

I saw him wilt and seemingly give up against Cub Swanson in 2012. I watched him succumb to neck pain against Holloway in 2015. I remember him tapping out to strikes against Felder in 2017.

So I built up this idea of him as this technical prodigy, who would choose the easy way out when things got tough during a fight.

Now a lot has been said about Oliveira switching camp to Chute Box in 2018 and subsequently going on a 9 fight win streak that culminated in him becoming the LW champ.

I don't think that all is a coincidence. I think Chute Box, a gym known for gruelling sparring sessions, was exactly what Oliveira needed to become a complete fighter. He needed that toughness and tenacity that comes from the Chute Box style grind and hard sparring.

Watching Oliveira eat bombs from Chandler and come back to win the belt was the perfect showcase of his evolution under Diego Lima.

He truly has become a lion among lions, to quote Oliveira himself.","Chute Box, Oliveira and teaching tenacity",45,1

\-***Least likely change, but worth mentioning***: The division's names are terrible, confusing, and just need to go altogether. First, they are identical across men and women's divisions which is very bizarre (calling Cris Cyborg a ""featherweight"" doesn't quite sound right). Secondly, they adopted the boxing division names for entirely different-sized fighters. 210lb Marvin Vettori is in the same weight division as GGG as far as the name goes (both middleweights). I'll only be using the lb numbers for division names here (e.g., 135lbs).

\-***Men's Weight Divisions:*** As has been noted a ton on here, the biggest issues arise in those average weight divisions (145-170lbs). If any changes need to be made, it starts with splitting that 170lbs into 165lb and 175lb divisions. UFC brass has expressed no interest in doing this, perhaps due to the history of the 170lb division. I say the 175lb division should inherit all of that divisional history, especially given the current champion is almost certain to end up in that 175lb division. It's 165lbs that should be treated as the ""new"" division. The second important change I'd love to see would be to make an open-weight division in place of the current 265lb heavyweight division, and then add a 225lb division for the smaller current heavyweights (e.g, Stipe, DC, Tanner Boser, Chris Daukaus, Oleinik, etc.).  A number of oversized 205ers would eventually move up and I think both 225lbs and open-weight would fill out well in time. Finally, and this one's a *bit* of a stretch, I would consider adding a Men's 115lb division as the sport grows. I have a couple training partners who could make that weight (\~130-135lbs) and I genuinely think flyweight will become stacked over these next 10 years. 

\-***Women's Weight Divisions******:*** With the women's side, I think the talent pool may need to grow a bit before adding weight divisions. However, I do think a women's open-weight division above 145lbs would be extremely fun and popular. In addition, 115lbs really isn't all that small for many women to make. A 105lb division does exist in other MMA organizations and I think plenty of current 115lbers would probably drop down to that 105lb division.

&amp;#x200B;

**Fantasy UFC weight divisions in 2024:**

Men's 115lb, 125lb, 135lb, 145lb, 155lb, 165lb, 175lb, 185lb, 205lb, 225lb, Openweight (&gt;225lbs)

The average age for a UFC champ is 33 years old. There is no current UFC champ in their 20s. 

Of all the sports out there, are there any other where you see this sort of average age at the top? In sports like basketball and football (outside of QB) you are usually considered to be in your way down once you hit 30. The same is true often for baseball and tennis. These sports (especially basketball, baseball and football) often have superstars emerge in their early twenties, which almost never happens in MMA.

Sure, you could contribute Tony's decline in his performance to his age, or as DC said, his 'lack of the fundamentals', but there is no denying that the beating he took from Justin had a lasting effect. 

So how does this argument stack up against Kattar? He is different to Tony in that he is 4 years younger than him and evidently takes a more orthodox approach to his fighting style. Do you think we will see a decline in his future performances? 

What has me hopeful for Kattar's future is how Brian Ortega looked in his return after his beating from Holloway. He took some time off and returned looking like an excellent fighter. 

I'm not well informed on this sort of stuff so I'm just curious what everyone else thinks. Kattar's fights are always entertaining to watch and I'd hate to see him endure a streak such as Tony's.",How damaging was the beating put on Calvin Kattar by Max Holloway?,49,1

Since moving to Middleweight, he has gone through a murderer's row. His resume is one of the most underappreciated in the sport. He has beaten a variety of fighters who all have diverse skillsets.

His resume includes:

* Uriah Hall - An explosive striker. This was after his Mousasi KO.
* Derek Brunson - An aggressive striker and powerful wrestler. Whitaker, through this win, broke a five fight win streak.
* Jacare Souza - A great brawler and an extremely accomplished BJJ artist.
* Darren Till - A highly technical point fighter.
* Yoel Romero - His best win in my opinion. Robert Whitaker (although the second fight was close) solved the enigma that was Yoel Romero with some of the best displays of takedown defence (even when hurt) as well as using horizontal movement. This win would break Romero's 8 fight murder spree which included the former champion Chris Weidman, Lyoto Machida, Tim Kennedy and Jacare Souza.
* Jared Cannonier - A win that is overlooked. Cannonier came of 3 straight (T)KO wins, one of which was over a legitimate contender. Probably the most powerful striker in the division and the scariest second only to Romero. A lot of people thought Cannonier would KO Whittaker.
* Kelvin Gastelum - A tough Boxer/wrestler.

I think Whitaker is sort of like Thomas Hearns in terms of being unlucky that his career coincided with the likes of another great.

They are obviously both amazing grapplers that have rounded out their games a lot.

How do you think this fight goes? would it go differently if it was a grappling only match? Charles is a weight class above Ortega but they are similarly sized since Ortega cuts so much weight.

I think the most likely answer is that if it were in mma it would just become a kickboxing fight since they both respect the others' bjj probably and when two great grapplers fight it rarely ends in a submission unless I'm forgetting some fights (Mir vs Nogueira and Renzo Gracy vs Sakuraba come to mind).",Oliveira vs Ortega,8,1

Striker vs Grappler, a tale as old as time in mma.

A close first round, a clear second and third respectfully. 

Regardless of the validity of the results of the judges, the events that follow are straight out of a book.

Israel sailed a ""smooth"" ride to the top, passing a progression of tests, each a magnitude greater than the last, &amp; became a superstar.

Marvin on the other hand, found himself feeling cheated and unfairly derailed from achieving his dream.

But he never lost hope. 

He was sidelined by USADA for a failed drug test, which put his fighting future in jeopardy. And even after the situation and suspension were sorted out, he found difficulty even getting inside the cage. Cancellations, reschedulings, the pandemic, all sorts of hurdles and detterents, all while watching the man he lost to reach the summit he left his small town in Italy so many years ago for. 

That  split decision literally sent them on two different paths, one paved and perfect, with guided instructions, the other rocky and unkept. 

And now, ironically, three years later, they meet in the same exact arena they fought for the first time.

**If you want some fights to look forward to here you go**

Main Card: Cyborg/Smith beat down, Austin Vanderford Vanzant vs Fabian “Not Leon” Edwards should be a skilled contest but possibly boring but hateable or meme worthy mic post fight interview. 

Also on the main card: **Jaleel Willis vs. Maycon Mendonca**

- very good fight. Essentially getting a 3 round LFA main event title fight as the 2nd main card fight 

- Valerie “Masterl Loureda returns and looks to go 4-0 as a big favorite with her fan friendly looks and Muay Thai Kwon Do Olympic style Tae Kwon Do ferocious kicks and trains out of ATT with a slew of top female fighters in the UFC. Hannah Guy for the upset! 

**Preliminary Card Is Stacked**

- Brett Johns (5-2 UFC, left UFC on 2-0 run including win over Montel Jackson and calf slicer on Joe Soto who was on a 3-0 UFC run) vs Danny Sabatello (won on Contender series talks a lot of shit but is a shit striker. He’s like a very shitty green Chael Sonnen at this point. He lost to Irwin Rivera (bad ufc fighter and attempted murderer) earlier in his career. Some are picking him to pull off the upset. Very weird to see a +200 and higher dog get picked this much my guess is the shit talking really convinces people. He has improved. Brett Johns is 17-2 only ever losing to Aljo and Pedro Munhoz. Bet on Sabatello really good odds if you like him 

- Alexander Shabliy vs Alfie Davies. Two good strikers. Should be a technical stand up fight while it lasts maybe some takedowns get mixed in but should be action packed 

- Janay Harding vs Leah McCourt. You know those fun sloppy fights? Janay Harding has tons of them, had a war with Amanda Bell throws a lot of volume clear striking advantage. Leah is a grappler and gonna get fucked up if she doesn’t get it to the ground. Both are hot 

- **Nate Andrews vs Saad Awad** guaranteed banger prelim headliner for a reason******
- Andrews is a very good striker and can finish with subs too. Awad likes to bang and 0-4 1 NC his last 5 fights. Both have KO power. Don’t count Awad out but this should be violent either way. Andrews gave Rashid Magomedov and Chris Wade everything they could handle. Even if you thought Rashid was robbed, Andrews still showed a lot of good strikes in that fight on the feet and also against Wade in PFL. This is a sneaky good fight. 
- Sumiko Inaba is a Hawaiian hot chick they’re trying to build up. She’s expected to run through her opponent big underdog

UFC, Bellator, ONE, rando pro promotions when my friends are fighting, local ammy promotions, etc. 

My biggest criticism of Bellator has always been that their production quality overall simply isn't where it needs to be. I don't know what it is specifically, maybe it's the cameras they use, the camera placement, or just an inability to put the whole thing together, but I think we all know that Bellator fighters always look slow and generally are not exciting. One hundred percent I believe this is due to their shitty camera work. You can even see in the shot comparison that their cameras are at a different angle and have a wider shot. 

In comparison, ONE does a much better job of framing the shots. Their fighters look just as fast as UFC fighters, the shots are tight, they switch cameras at the right times, etc. It's not quite the production quality of the UFC but it's easily the next runner up, standing at 2 on the podium. 

Now, if you look at the clothing of ONE fighters, the production really falls apart IMO. I don't mean this to sound sexist AT ALL because the design of the clothing is not specifically up to the fighters, but things really look terrible in some of the womens' fights. The May 15th card, for example, had a good back-and-forth between [Killer Bee and Ritu Phogat](https://youtu.be/ZyAnTzcnJAI?t=3350). Starting at 55:50 - this fight is REALLY fun and a great example for why we should have Atomweights in every promotion. These women exist and are just as skillful as 115, 125, 135lbers, etc. Ritu put on half of a wrestling clinic, Bi caught her with a vicious Dan Hooker style knee up the middle and turned the pressure on in Rd 3 for the split decision; just a great fight overall.

What takes away from the whole thing though is their clothes. Ritu is sporting the Evolve getup, so she does look professional, but Bi is in there in like, Lululemon pants and a shirt/bra combo that it looks like she got from Target. These are PROFESSIONAL ATHLETES. What the FUCK are we doing letting them be televised wearing shit you see amateur fighters in? 

I honestly think ONE is letting themselves down by not springing for official fight kits and just letting the athletes continue to print sponsor logos on there. The cost cannot be that outrageous and I am certain some global brand will produce them in exchange for their name on the clothing.

I thought I’d share and see if others agreed with my list for the top five winners and losers of the week. This list is not necessarily if an underdog wins or a favorite loses. This list won’t put a heavy favorite who won as the biggest winner even if they won in spectacular fashion, but instead tries to encompass an overall aspect of their performance from multiple angles such as history, expectations, and future.

5. Victor Rodriguez 

Starting off the top 5, I am going with a pretty big underdog. Typically, when an underdog loses, I don’t like to rag on them as they weren’t expected to do too much when the odds are +300 and above, but the second biggest underdog went way below expectations.  Rodriguez threw 3 punches, didn’t land a single one, and got rocked by three strikes from Silva. Obviously, this was expected, but the newcomer has now lost both his UFC fights by KO, bit more importantly, just got annihilated by Silva. Another factor is that even the biggest underdog on the card, Alves, was able to go the distance against his performance and even take a round off of Ismagulov. And I know, not every underdog is built the same, but this was just a disaster for Rodriguez.

4. Raulian Paiva and Ronderos

This is really more of a three parter as Dvorak really comes out as a winner here but won’t get his name on the top five winners due to pre-fight odds being at -590. But more importantly, this is a loss for the other fighters in general. First, Paiva, who was the #12 flyweight, was hospitalized after a brutal weight cut. Ronderos was selected as a replacement, but missed weight. So on top of only getting less than a day to prepare, he had to forfeit his purse as well for missing weight. Talk about Brutal. Ronderos was a huge underdog and Dvorak made easy work wit ha failed takedown by Ronderos and got a sick one handed submission. This fight should not really count against Ronderos as the newcomer got shafted with weight ins and purse snatching, but still an L for this fight.

3.  Claudia Silva

The closest odds of the fight card were between Silva and McGee, but you wouldn’t know it by the dominating performance Mcgee had on Silva. Silva was dominated by McGee who had 8 minutes of control time and landed 3/5 takedowns, whereas Silva had less than 2 minutes of control and went 1/10 of takedowns. Silva, who had beaten Leon Edwards, was ready to bounceback from a pretty brutal fight against James Krause where Silva landed 66/216 strikes and Krause landed 94/159. Silva wasn’t the biggest favorite (or one at all since odds fluctuated before the fight), but just the performance was overall not great

2.  Cody Garbandt 

Cody Garbandt has been on a crazy path in the last few years, going from being one of only three people to beat Dominic Cruz (He was the second to beat him in a decade until Cejudo beat him), then proceeded to lose three straight (two to Dillashaw and one to Pedro Muhnoz) before winning a fight with a literal buzzer beater KO. This was the fight he’s been looking for since the Dillashaw days, fight and you are in championship contention; lose, and you are out. Cody gave it his all, and it’s a testament to his strength to go the distance after taking 183 STRIKES AND 145 OF THOSE TO THE HEAD. But other than maybe the last round of the fight, Cody lost the first four rounds of the fight. This placement is not necessarily due to bad performance, but the impact is pretty grave. Bantamweight has so many contenders that any stumble could snowball.

1. Yan Xianon

This placement is again a case of not being the biggest favorite to lose, but the biggest favorite who had everything to lose. There were discussions of Xianon going against Namajunas next for the title if she came out with a victory, but instead got absolutely mauled in the second round by Esparza. Xianon had a poor first two rounds anyways, so it wouldn’t have even mattered. Esparza finished the fight going 3/3 on takedowns and a brutal barrage of punches that resulted in the KO. With the loss Xianon now has to face probably two more fighters before a shot with Esparza moving up and Joanna and Zhang itching to take on the champ. 

Honorable Mention: The fans who have to wait two weeks

Honestly, this loser is a testament to how good the card was. Sure some favorite like Spencer, Tafa, and Algeo lost, but those fights were not career killers and all the above fighters showed their stuff in the octagon (well maybe not Algeo who just seemed like he could never get in stride), but none of them deserved to be on the losers list. Other underdogs who lost bad like Neurdanbieke and Barnett put out pretty poor performances, but not 0/3 and KO’d bad, especially with Barnett stepping in pretty late as well. So the honorable loser goes to fans who have to wait until June 5th for a heavyweight matchup of sakai vs rozenstruik before getting a juicy UFC PPV event featuring two title fights. 

Top Five Winners

5. Ricardo Ramos

A slight underdog who won, Ramos comes in at the number 5 spot due to his precision and methodical fighting style. Ramos never let up and easily won the first two rounds of the fight against Algeo who is both good in striking and wrestling with 6 wins by submissions out of 14 wins. Ramos was able to takedown Algeo 8 times, and although there was not a lot of follow up usually after the takedowns, Ramos was still able to maintain control for the majority of the fight and never let Algeo have any breathing room until the third round. Overall, a solid performance for Ramos that lands him here.

4. Jack Hermansson

Hermansson has been an enigma for quite some time in the Middleweight world. Jack has wins against Kevin Gastelum, Jacare Souza, and Meerschaert, but loses to Vettori and Cannonier. So every time he gets a good signature win, he loses and heads back down the rankings. Although coming in as a slight favorite, Hermansson showed off an impressive arsenal of his skills, going 3.6 on takedowns, over 7 minutes of control, and showing a strong ground and pound game that just dominated Shahbazyan. Although Shahbazyan was able to take off a round, Hermansson got another solid win that will hopefully move him back up

3. Rob Font

Winners of the main event usually end up in the top two, but Font has some caveats to his ranking. Font comes in as a winner who will most likely be fighting for a belt soon, but the bantamweight division is so blurry, who knows when that will be. Overall, font took care of business. Landing 183 strikes and dominating for the first four rounds, Font has shown he belongs in the upper tier of fighters in the division, but as who his next opponent is, is anyone’s guess. It’s hard to move up his ranking as well due to the solid performances of the other two fighters above him, but he could be easily the number 1 winner on any other night. 

2. Carla Esparza

As mentioned above Esparza came up with an absolute dominate performance. Not only by winning by KO in the second round, but also clearly showing who the more skilled fighter was in the octagon. Although a slight underdog, Esparza was ranked one spot below Yan in strawweight rankings and now has 5 straight wins. Esparza has shown she is capable of going toe to toe with some of the best fighters. She already has a win over Namajunas (albeit from 2014), and a loss to Joanna (in 2015), so we may be seeing some rematches in the future. 

1. Jared Vanderaa 

I had Vanderaa written off even before the fight started. Like many watchers, we were confused about the high billing of the fight and everyone was rooting for Tafa. Vanderaa had other plans. Quickly this fight became fight of the night, and photos of bloodied Jared starting appearing on my timeline with everyone who wasn’t following the fights shocked that he won. Vanderaa now moves up to 12-5 and proved that he is one hell of a fighter with this performance.

&amp;#x200B;

**David Dvorak - One Arm Rear Naked Choke**

Ronderos shoots for a takedown and Dvorak takes double underhooks and uses a shallow underhook to shuck elbow to elbow upwards to expose and take the back. Dvorak immediately inserts a near hook and same side choking arm. Ronderos’ primary defensive hand and arm are not defending Dvorak is able to sink in a deep choke with the choking elbow aligned with the chin, hand behind the shoulder and chin tucked on the shoulder. 

They break down to a hip on the same side of the choke and Dvorak has superior position and is able to maintain with ease. He takes the non choking arm and controls the same side arm from underneath to prevent/slow rotation. He upgrades from a single hook to two hooks. 

Ronderos, due to having his back taken, has his feet accessible to the ground to change hip base. He attempts the other side but Dvorak maintains the orientation of the choke (head on one side, choking arm on other) and chokes him out with one arm. The mechanic is to squeeze and retract the choking elbow backwards while maintaining orientation.

**Ben Rothwell's 10 Finger Guillotine Choke**

Barnett shoots a desperation double leg and gets sprawled on by Rothwell. Rothwell converts into an aggressive front head which converts into a 10 finger guillotine. Barnett tries to unsuccessfully spin out of the choke but his head is stuck on the chest of Rothwell. This is one of the few variants of guillotines where no cross control is needed on the body (meaning if you have a left handed guillotine, you would minimally require controlling the right side of their lower body (from your perspective) to minimise movement.",Breakdown of Submission Victories from UFC Fight Night 188,1,1

My body is super, and I mean super, skinny. I’m kinda exaggerating but point is that I got no muscle mass at all so I thought maybe I’d wait to train in MMA until after like 4-6 months of bodybuilding but after doing research it seems that’d be pointless because after I’m done bodybuilding I’m gonna start doing strength and conditioning to improve my training which includes cardio which means my 4-6 months of bodybuilding would kinda be pointless right?

* write a haiku
* draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

I thought I’d post here for ideas because I’m rather stuck at this point. I have been a fan of the sport since being young, aspiring to work within it for sometime, but never believing it could happen. But I just got to a point and thought fuck it, this is a future I’d like to try and make a reality, I’m ready to pack up my things to move wherever it takes me. I’ve attempted contact people within the sport, but with no luck and there doesn’t seem to be many entrance level jobs on offer. Has anyone got any advice or previous experience in this area? Or could point me in the right direction to achieve this? I could be potentially overestimating the accessibility of entering this field, especially as a graduate, but I thought I may as well ask.

I love the parody of having a ring vs a cage and  unified rules vs JMMA rules because I feel it changes strategy and sometimes to the point it could change fight outcomes.

IMO Rizin should heavily invest in the FLW and BW divisions and cross-promote with Bellator and One FC since talent in those weight classes are on par with the UFC compared to the rest. Would also be cool if they could get a DAZN deal because IMO soccer kicks and stomps are too brutal for primetime TV it would be way better than FITE. 

Rizin should focus on becoming PRIDE Bushido instead of PRIDE FC in terms of scale and in terms of showcasing lighter weight classes.

For example, when you watch basketball, football, or hockey - I suggest watching what's infront of the ball/puck, the players around the object. 

In mma, I don't know if I should watch the aggressor, the other fighter, or somewhere in the middle.

I had to deal with a young lady getting shot in front of my house, two occasions where men wouldn’t get off my porch, and a number of other situations at local quick marts that could of turned out bad.   Usually I just turn tail like a little bitch.  The men on my porch I had to get loud but,..honestly I don’t want to call the cops because I’m afraid that someone could get actually killed by them.   I know that sounds stupid, but it’s a reality of where I live (California). The law enforcement is nationally known for slow response and escalating situations.   

I have some basic combative training from the military (level 1) but I’m older and fatter now.  I’m wondering if MMA would give me some ability to at least defend myself and not get stomped out,..hopefully walk away the winner.  

At 44 I’m worried if the training would cause me more injuries than it’s worth and maybe I should just continue to avoid conflict.  However, I feel there is going to be a day where I won’t be able too.

For example, Dillashaw. I was a fan until I found out he's a cheater. Now he's coming back with his record still intact despite being proven that he was a cheater.

Why aren't cheaters banned for life? If they're gonna let them back anyway, why ban it in the first place? At least make the playing field even and be clear that it's okay to use PEDs.

Even if they stop using, they already benefitted from it. Their bodies are already changed forever. They probably wouldn't even reach the level they're at without it. Some bosybuilders even just do one cycle and they're forever different. It's not like they go back to being ""natural"" if they stop using.

I personally don't have anything against PEDs. But I feel like the rules are all just for show for social acceptance. The problem is giving certain players an edge because of uneven/arbitrary enforcement of rules. Why add the factor of being ""how good you cycle your PEDs to to undetected"" to the competition?

 It should either be allowed or it's not.",Why are Dopers allowed to return to compete?,5,1

To combat weight cutting, they do two weigh ins. The first goes just the same as usual, the night before hit weight by any means necessary. 

But then another weigh in, with an allowance (flexible number, 3 pounds?), basically ringside. The idea being, if you really weigh 175 pounds, with an empty stomach, you can then eat and get ready within that 3 pound allowance for fight night, where you weigh 178. People looking for a weight advantage would only be able to get a 3 pound advantage, if that. And again, the allowance is flexible.

This is my first ever attempt at MMA analysis after being a fan for approximately 16 months. Please leave any feedback you have in the comments and I apologize for this being so late, I had several exams since the semester just ended.  

**Result:**  

Charles Oliveira defeats Michael Chandler by TKO at 0:19 of the 2nd round 

**Major Takeaways:** 

1. Chandler has ""fuck you"" power  
2. Oliveira can no longer be considered a quitter, at least for the time being. 
3. Chandler made a decision at the end of the 1st round to stay in Oliveira's guard and not stand him up, this decision may have cost him the fight but based off the finish perhaps not. 
4. Oliveira's grappling ability acts as a fall back plan if he is outclassed on the feet. Chandler does not have this luxury. 

**Round 1:** 

**Opening Striking: (0:00-0:42)** 

Oliveira opens up very kick heavy, including 2 leg kicks that knockdown Chandler, he places a lot of weight in the front leg. We see plenty of leg kicks and some front kicks mixed in for good measure. Chandler opens with the same jab high, right to the body attack he used for the entirety of the Hooker fight. In that fight he went 2:30 before throwing the left to the head and it ended the fight. This time he throws it 1:00 in albeit without the stance switch. I highly doubt that Chandler and Hooft were expecting that to work again but it does fit into Chandler saying that he doesn’t have an especially diverse arsenal of strikes. Neither fighter backing down at this point which was surprising to see, especially on Oliveira's part. Chandler's power shows up 40 seconds into the fight with a left that even through Oliveira's high guard manages to crack him a bit.  

**Takedown Attempt/Back Take: (0:42-1:30)** 

Oliveira shoots for a double that Chandler transitions into an arm-in guillotine. It's never actually tight however, despite what Rogan and DC believed. Oliveira pops his head up and is now only 1 leg away from having mount. Chandler does his best to create space and tries to turn and stand up but Oliveira closes distance and as Chandler is turning to stand up he takes the back and gets both hooks in. He immediately begins attacking the RNC and going for wrist control. At this point Chandler stands up and right before he goes for the back slam Oliveira locks in the body triangle.  

**Hand Fighting and Scramble: (1:30-2:20)** 

And here we get to some very interesting grappling. The obvious attack here for Oliveira is the rear naked choke, and to accomplish that he needs to get an arm over Chandler's shoulder and under the chin. Once that arm is in the fight is most likely over. So Chandler does the right thing and begins hand fighting like his life depends on it. Chandler is trying to keep his arms up so that Charles cannot get the arm under his chin. Both fighters are also battling for wrist control at this point. Now this is the beginning of Chandler's ingenious scramble/reversal (thank you to u/GenTelGuy and u/ImEdwardd) . The first thing we can notice here is how Chandler forces both of Oliveira's arms above his head (credit to u/alexanderknox for pointing this out to me). Whilst holding Oliveira's arms above his head Chandler now begins to attack the body triangle. He times this perfectly as right when Oliveira begins to attempt to readjust his grip Chandler bucks violently creating just an inch or two which he then rotates completely, shifting himself into guard. Obviously not wanting to stay on the ground with Oliveira he lets him up and we return to the feet 

**Closing Striking Exchange: (3:56-5:00)** 

For some reason Oliveira looks significantly less sharper on the feet here, I'm not sure if some of the grappling had tired him out but he throws much less and mainly looks to dodge Chandler's strikes. Chandler takes immediate advantage of this doing an excellent job of cage cutting and forcing Oliveira to the cage with a flurry of jabs. Now what happens here is pretty interesting. Chandler seems to knock down Oliveira with a right but I honestly think Oliveira was looking for a takedown, just in a very awkward and poorly timed manner. Now on his knees, Chandler rains down hell on Oliveira with right hand after right hand but almost none of them land. Oliveira is usually quite well-known for his poor head movement but he displays incredible movement here on the ground as he slips and ducks almost every punch from Chandler. He now pulls guard and forces Chandler to fight through it. And then even all of the ground and pound thrown from Oliveira's guard misses, hitting the canvas quite frequently. Oliveira holds onto a body lock and manages to survive the round. Now, like many when watching the fight I believed Oliveira to be in serious trouble during this final striking exchange. But watching it back I don't believe that Oliveira was ever hurt at all and a stoppage would have been ill-advised. 

**2nd Round:** 

**Finish: (0:00-0:19)** 

Obviously the shortest segment of the fight, After rewatching the finish I must say that it was an incredibly crisp piece of boxing from Charles Oliveira. Right before, Chandler goes in for a power right to the body as Oliveira misses with a straight right that Chandler ducks under as he's punching. Both punches miss and as Chandler returns to his stance and gets back to an upright position he is immediately left with an incredibly precise left hook right on the jaw. The timing and precision of this strike is something I would expect from someone like Israel Adesanya or Dustin Poirier, so I am curious to see what we will continue to see from Do Bronx. It is timed to perfection and knocks Chandler down. However he is still not out completely just dazed so he gets to his feet and attempts to circle out to his right away from Oliveira's power hand. He eats a few elbows and rights and as he's sprinting and Oliveira is chasing him he gets hit with a clean running left hook that looks quite similar to the left that KO'd Hooker in Chandler's win back in January. He is dropped, Oliveira jumps on him and finishes the fight, cementing himself as the new undisputed UFC Lightweight Champion.  

**Final Thoughts/Notes:** 

* Oliveira is worryingly hittable, considering that his next fight will be against either Dustin Poirier or Conor McGregor it is a concern for me. 
* Oliveira has an underrated chin, eating multiple shots from Michael Chandler is no small feat 
* I would not be surprised to see Michael Chandler back in a UFC title fight. He has power to rival Justin Gaethje and his ground game is quite solid. However his age is a concern so he better be ""here for a good time not a long time"" as he has stated previously. 
* Oliveira vs Poirier just became a very interesting fight, I was very impressed with Oliveira in this fight. 
* Chandler was not lying when he said that he does not have too many types of punches, just a couple that are really good. His right to the body then left to the head combo is very clearly his bread and butter.  

**Matchups to Make:** 

* Oliveira vs Winner of UFC 264 
* Chandler vs Gaethje  
* Dariush vs Loser of UFC 264 (Unlikely to happen if McGregor is the loser) 
* Ferguson :(",UFC 262 Main Event Analysis,18,1

The auto-translation isn't great so I thought I'd throw in some translation work. Other people can free to correct me in the comments where I'm wrong. I wrote this and realized that translating is hard and I'm regretting this.

&amp;#x200B;

Q: *How is your conditioning throughout your fight camp?*

A: Conditioning is great. I'm on track with my weight. No injuries either, even though there's always going to be injuries in fight camp. I put a lot of attention into my conditioning.

Q: *You're coming back after your loss to Ortega this fight.*

A: Well I prepared in Korea last fight and there were a lot of difficulties that everyone knows about. I'm in America now, and consider this a very important fight. I think I still have a run at the title, so this is a good opportunity.

Q: *How are you preparing for Dan Ige? Any changes to training or strategies?*

A: Just doing what my coaches want me to do at Fight Ready. Last time I asked my team to come to Korea, and the results weren't great. And I got in a lot of trouble with my coaches. So now I'm just listening to my coaches.

Q: *Why did you accept the fight against a lower ranked Dan Ige?*

A: I just want to fight as soon as I could, and Ige had a great performance in his last fight. Plus, with all of the top 5 occupied, especially with Yair and Holloway fighting, I didn't think I could be inactive and raise my ranking. Honestly, I  wanted to fight Yair the most, but that didn't work out. I also wanted Holloway as well. But neither of them needed to fight me. If I fight Ige and win, I think I can call them out.

Q: *You've always said you love fighting in the cage, but what specifically do you like about it?*

A: (A bit hard to translate for me)

Q: *There's a lot of up and coming Korean UFC fighters that are having success. How do you feel as a veteran Korean fighter?*

Everyone in the media is already saying great things about them. If I had to say one negative thing, I think your fight performance is more important than the result. Obviously, winning is better than losing. But if you have a great performance, I think you can win over a lot of fans more easily. If you're facing a highly ranked fighter, you should be smart and cautious. But if that's not the case, then I think you should take more risks to put on a good show in order to leave a good impression. Just to clarify, I'm not saying they're doing poorly. They're doing very well. I think it's better to be a bit more ambitious.

Q: *Compared to previous fights, it seems like you're trying to use all the time to go to a decision.*

A: Well that's when I didn't know how to train. Now, I'm much more technical, scientific, and precise with my training. To be a complete fighter, you have to have a good game plan. And that's how I prepared for Moicano and Edgar, which had good results. I lost my last fight to Ortega, where I trained in Korea, so I don't think people need to think that way. I have to just prove myself every time that I'm doing well.

Q: *When fans watch your next fight, what are the things that they should be on the look out for?*

A: Hmm... Well... I'm hoping they can see a more mature, complete fighter. I'm continuing to improve. I've always added new skills to my game every fight, and I want to show just how much more I've improved.

Q: *You've put in a lot of time and money into your fight camps. After you loss to Ortega, do you have any new thoughts or regrets on that?*

A: I think a big mistake in my career has been being training in Korea, instead of going to the US. Of course, it wasn't possible for me when I was younger. The reason why I come to the US and train at Fight Ready is... well.. I think only the people closest to me understand why. Here at Fight Ready, nutrition, coaching, strength and conditioning are all better. You can't find this in Korea. I've been fighting for 18 years now. I would be stupid to not use my time and money to train here. Please understand I have my reasons for training here, and I'd appreciate it if my fans understood this.

Q: *What do you say to fighters that look up to you as a role model?*

I talked to Donghyun Kim about this recently, but I think fighters need to put on fun, exciting fights in order to grow the sport in Korea. Of course your fighting record is important, but you have to be sell fights and sell yourself. There's just too much of a difference between the United States and Korea in terms of fighter ""infrastructure"" and support. I'm really jealous of that. Brazil is up there too. If Korean MMA wants to keep up with US and Brazil MMA, we need fun, exciting fighters from Korea.

Q: *Dan Ige is calling himself the Hawaiian Zombie. What do you think about that?*

A: Well I think he's trying to sell this fight. It seems that Zombies... can get knocked out though. They're known to go unconscious haha. But I love that confidence. If he wants to brawl with me, I'll welcome it any day.

Q: *Fans are discussing that there's not going to be too many more opportunities to cheer for you and that your last fight is coming up. How do you feel about that?*

A: (Something something something)... I'm taking it fight by fight.

Q: *Ever since you accepted another five round fight, we're hearing about new training methods. Could you tell us what those methods are?*

A: I'm trying some of Henry Cejudo's training methods. He does a lot of no contact sparring and simulations. He trains for any and every type of situation that can happen in a fight. That's how he trains. And I've tried it. But I think we're different fighters. Cejudo's base is in wrestling, and so I think that's why it works for him. So I'm going back to some of my regular training, which is what my coaches want for me and have brought in a lot of sparring partners. When I was training for Moicano and Ortega (before Edgar stepped in for Ortega after he was injured), we brought in a lot of bigger fighters, welterweights. And so I took a lot of hits, and had to frequently ice my head. We brought in smaller sparring partners, and I don't think I'm taking as much head damage. So I'm back to training the way I was training previously.

Q: *As you are training, do you still not like preparing for five round fights?*

A: Training for five round fights is always tough. Fighting a five round fight on fight day is nothing. I can do ten rounds if I need to, it doesn't matter. After the Ortega fight, I was hoping to get a 3 round fight, if I'm not fighting a highly ranked contender or a title fight. But the UFC had me take a 5 round fight because I can still be a title contender.

Q: *When you talked about wanting 3 round fights, many people had the impression that, mentally, you're no longer wanting to be competing for the title.*

A: I wanted to accept 3 round fights, until I was in a position where I had to take a 5 round fight for the title. That's what I wanted. If I was too afraid of 5 round fights, then I would have already retired.

Q: *Ahh I see it was a silly concern*

A: Haha no problem. Thanks.

Q: *After your loss, a lot of lower ranked fighters have been fighting each other and climbing the rankings. Are you worried?*

A: (I can't translate this either).

Q: *As the leading Korean UFC fighter, do you feel a sense of responsibility? Does it feel isolating?*

A: Responsibility? No, thinking that way is just an unnecessary burden. It does feel a bit isolating though, but I have great teammates who believe in me and support me. And I take care of them as well. My attitude is as long as I'm doing well, as long as we're doing well, then it'll be ok.

Q: T*here's not a lot of upside in fighting Dan Ige. How do you get motivated for it?*

A: As a higher ranked fighter, if I don't take lower ranked fighters then the whole division will not move and get stuck. If I beat Ortega, then I probably don't have a reason to fight Ige. But because I lost, it makes sense that I accept the Ige fight. And if I want to be a champion, I have to get past Ige. That's plenty motivation for me.

Q: *What's your secret for training as a fighter in your 30s?*

A: There's a bit of a difference fighting in my 30s versus my 20s. I get a bit more fatigued quickly. But it's not a big difference. I supplement well and take better care of my nutrition. In the US, people really care about your nutrition and being scientific.

Q: *How competitive are Korean UFC fighters?*

A: It feels too early to just compliment them. You can't really know for sure. Doo Ho hasn't fought in so long. As for the other fighters, they are winning. But it's hard to tell right now. I'm sure a big opportunity will come, and I hope they prepare for it well.

&amp;#x200B;

=================================================================================

&amp;#x200B;

Q: *What do you think Dan Ige thinks your weaknesses are?*

A: Well, he probably thinks I'm vulnerable to kicks. I haven't shown my BJJ very often, so maybe he thinks I'm weak there. I've had some pretty spectacular knock outs, so he might suspect my chin isn't the same. He probably thinks my footwork is bad.

Q: *How has your fight camp changed for Ige?*

A: I'm planning my camp specifically around Ige obviously. I can't reveal everything. But I'm aware that Ige is probably training against my weaknesses, and I hope my fans understand that I am aware.

Q: *Fans are worried that you're going to get hit with another spinning elbow.*

A: Haha. Well I'm sparring a rotation of 3 or 4 fighters fighters, 3 or 4 rounds. Each of them probably do 3 spinning attacks each round with me. I'm preparing so much for spinning attacks, and if I'm still caught with one, then that means I simply can't beat spinning attacks. I've trained so much for them. I shouldn't say this, but if I lose to a spinning attack, then I will seriously consider retiring.

Q: *On your Instagram, you recently said that you're less inclined in fighting at lightweight after training with one of your partners, Mike Madsen.*

A: Well Mike is a wrestler that's looking of a team. I think he's from Denmark. I haven't sparred with him, but he watched all of my sparring. (some more info here that I couldn't translate)

Q: *Were you able to get the vaccine in the US?*

A: My wife and two training partners were able to get vaccinated, but I wasn't. I talked to doctors in the US, and we decided that it's best to not get it just yet. It's a bit complicated to explain everything in detail, but no I have not gotten it.

Q: *Were you frustrated with the announcement of the Yair-Holloway fight?*

A: I was pretty surprised by that. I don't think about fighting too much as a business. If I want to fight, then I'll fight. I think that's why Sean Shelby likes me. Maybe he say that to everyone. There's hundreds of thousands of dollars with this fight, so if Yair approached it like a business then he's really smart. How do I say this.... yeah he's just a really smart fighter.

Q: *Would getting the title fight after the Ige fight be the best case scenario?*

A: After beating Ige, I was hoping to call out Holloway. But with Yair fighting, that's not possible. I'll have to really re-evaluate who to fight with people getting injured and changes in the ranking. I'm now just thinking about my fight with Ige.

Q: *What do you think of the rising Asian hate crimes in America?*

A: I think I made a comment about this in an American interview recently. But I don't know where COVID started. It could be the US, China, somewhere else in Asia. But to blame all of the people just because it started there doesn't make sense. If an Asian gets shot and killed in the US, then I can't blame all of America. I think it's the same situation.

Q: *A lot of fighters are calling you out and saying that you're a legend. What do you think of that?*

A: Fighters call me out because it's easy to call me out. I don't think that's something I really like to be frank. As for calling me a legend, I have noticed in America recently. Not that I am a legend, but a lot of people are recognizing me, like me, and respect me, and that feels great.

Q: *Any complications after your eye surgery?*

A: None at all. The surgery went well, and no side effects or complications. I recently did an eye exam with UFC doctors, and that went well without any issue.

Q: *Predictions on Yair-Holloway and Volk-Ortega?*

A: I think Holloway will win. Yair has his kicks, but in my opinion if he doesn't have a size advantage, then I don't know if they will be effective. Holloway also has good footwork, so I don't think Yair will be able to kick him. Holloway also has better cardio. A kick heavy style is also quite tiring. As for Volk vs Ortega, I used to think that Volk would win. But Ortega can fight both orthodox and southpaw. I don't think Volk's leg kicks will be effective against Ortega's footwork. And I don't think Volk can take Ortega down once. So I see a lot of scenarios where Ortega wins.

Q: *McGregor - Poirier 3rd fight?*

A: I'm a big Poirier fan, but I think McGregor will win this time. Poirier won the second fight and used his wrestling. As long as McGregor defends against leg kicks, I don't think Poirier can win. To put it simply. I hope Poirier doesn't hear this.

Q: *After the second fight, what does McGregor need to add to his game?*

A: McGregor's wide, front foot heavy stance prevented him from avoiding leg kicks. But if he shortens his stance, isn't so front foot heavy, and works on pulling his leg in and out, then he can win. He doesn't have to be as Karate style and have that in-and-out footwork that he had in his first fight with Poirier, but I think he can make those adjustments to win.

Q: *Predictions for your Korean Zombie MMA fighter Jun Young Hong* [https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/89841-jun-young-hong](https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/89841-jun-young-hong)

A: I've trained Jun Young and another fighter more than anyone else. Jun Young is a fighter that trains very hard and can do what he wants. If he executes the game plan the way he trained, then I think he'll win. I can't say how he'll win, but there are things we prepared for.

Q: *Masvidal started Gamebred FC, will you create Zombie FC?*

A: I've talked about wanting to do that in the past, but after talking with promoters in the local Korean MMA scene I've realized that I don't want to get into that space. It's too hard for me to operate something like that. I have no thoughts of anything like that.

Q: *Anything you'd like to say to Dan Ige?*

A: I decided to stop trash talking. So I hope you're training well, you don't get injured, and we're able to have a good fight.

Q: *What are your plans for next year with fighting?*

A: I want to fight in Korea next year. SPOTV said they'd have another fight last year and this year, but COVID ended that. Next year, hopefully we can have a UFC fight in Korea. Last time it was in Busan, so I hope we can have a fight in Seoul.

Q: *What would you like to say to your wife and kids?*

A: (ok I don't know how to translate this at all. Too flowery language for me).

Q: *How is it fighting without fans?*

A: In my Ortega fight, it felt too quiet. I remember my first two rounds thinking that. Now that I've experienced fighting without fans once, I think I can handle it better. But at the same time I could hear my corner very clearly. And my coach speaks to me in Korean, so my opponents can't understand that. And without fans, I felt less nervous and I could showcase my abilities better.

Hi guys, making a project based on fighter's nationalities. This is an end segment of a presentation to show a broad range of diversity in sport, with the UFC in focus. I was hoping to get help from you folk to determine who you want representing which location or country. Ideally active fighters, but no harm mentioning someone you consider a legend or noteworthy. Men or women, any weight class. It doesn’t have to be someone in the UFC if you really don’t want to. I find the UFC as a company, and MMA as the sport, to be interesting examples. They are both young in comparison to other established sports. Yet in a short span of time, we can see large portions of the world being represented. 

The idea is to showcase top fighter(s) for a varied nationality. This based on their citizenship, who they identify as and public reception. A fighter like Paul Felder claims German and Irish descent but fights under the US banner. He is also born and raised there, and to my knowledge no overseas citizenship. Therefore, I would write him up as solely an American representative, to eliminate too much subjectivity and cluster. Since certain countries are vast like continents, with huge cultural bearing on MMA, Russia, USA, Brazil etc. I might consider breaking them into states or regions of sorts. For instance, Chechnya is a constituent republic of Russia that could be mentioned alongside Dagestan, a Russian republic. This, to bring in a few noteworthy athletes of the sport. For the US it could be divided into states, preferably over major cities. The exact definition of how ‘large a region’ is up for interpretation, as the idea is to show a map filled in with candidates from all over the globe. MMA is a sport, like others, that truly unites people and breaks down old fashioned barriers. 

It’s been a few years where we have seen the UFC have a meteoric rise globally. Local scenes all over are experiencing enormous growth. The sport is still to be unbanned in certain countries and it also takes time to produce UFC caliber fighters. Reports of 2020 state, that the UFC consists of 724 fighters representing a total of 71 countries. Cuts have been made then so this figure Is not certain as things stand. On UFC’s website they state 1015 athletes, this number includes retired fighters. 

So, who do you want being mentioned and shown? To get the ball rolling, I have given some examples beneath. Not all are active for some variation to bring in a few legends. Again, do not get to bogged down on politics and exact terms. Just spit names! Would be nice if you wrote why this particular fighter and what area you want him to represent. 

New York: Jon Jones. best from each state? Who gets your vote from your HomeState or other? 

Czechia: Jiri 

Sweden: Chimaev, Hermansson, Teymur, Ilir or Gustafsson? 

Quebec: GSP 

Ireland: Lobov of course 

Serbia: Rakic 

Netherlands: Overeem, Mousasi? 

Kyrgyzstan: Valentina 

Dagestan: Islam Makachev, Khabib 

Brazil, Japan, China, Japan, Germany, UK, Brazil, are some of the bigger countries. 

 

Bigger list if someone wants to go at it. These I have checked have active fighters on the UFC roster. You can fill in what you like. You can play a challenging game of trying to name the fighters. I won't write the names of the fighters I have selected so far to not influence your picks. I will add the ones to my presentation based on your responses if I can get some. Ultimately post my slides on here for those who are interested, if works allow it.

One’s the fighters are selected I will make a write up on each one to further showcase diversity from a cultural standpoint too. For example, the major practicing religions in the area, language, socio-economics, ethnicity etc. Things that make you, you, and me, me.

He’s a very entertaining fighter, I don’t expect him to go on a title run.

Walt Harris rematch (13-9) - This one is a stretch because Walt is ranked #8 but he is coming off of 2 loses and if he loses his match against Marcin Tybura, he should fight Barnett since Barnett has already beat Harris

Todd Duffee (9-3) - He’s coming off of a no contest in 2019 and a loss in 2015 before that 

Gian Villante (17-13) - He’s coming off of 3 straight losses, 2 of the last ones being at heavyweight 

Roque Martinez (15-7-2) - He is 0-2 since making his UFC debut and is booked against Josh Parisian, win or lose, I’d like to see him fight Barnett

It was a smaller promotion I think it was on UFC fight pass. I remember seeing that the one guy was like undefeated with a small amount of fights and the other guy had a bit of losses from Alaska regional scene. It was the maim event and I remember the commentators hyping it up to be awesome. The guy with a bit of losses threw a kick early in the fight and twisted his ankle or something and then tapped out immediately. The guy that I believe was undefeated I think his name was Dave and he was a black guy the other guy I think they said he was hawaiian?

I worked hard for a long time, and I trained very hard every day. And I brought a big team of mine to America, yet the match ended this early. Deep inside, I couldn’t accept this fact.”

&gt;""It’s because I put in so much effort to prepare for this fight, and it was very tough for me every day. But because of one misjudgement that I made, I thought she was doing a low-kick, and I had a defense for the low kick, but she made a high-kick instead. And it was very sudden, very quick. And it’s not like we went for three rounds and she overpowered me, or even after one round if she overpowered me and I lost, then I would admit that my skills weren’t as good. But this one is really.. you know. I didn’t have a chance to show what I’ve got. So I felt wronged.”

I calculated the win percentage of all of the opponents of five of the greatest MMA fighters of all time, Khabib Nurmagomedov, Georges St-Pierre, Anderson Silva, Jon Jones, and Stipe Miocic.

I divided their opponents into opponents they beat and opponents they lost to and divided the wins by the total number of fights in each category. Then I divided the total wins of all of their opponents by the total fights all of their opponents had. I did not include NCs for either the champs or their opponents since technically, they do not count. I used current records, not the records of the opponents at the time of the fight. Everyone they fought more than once I included as many times. 

A bit more detailed explanation of what I did with the results is included in a video I made for my YouTube channel and a link to the spreadsheet with the data is below. Please let me know if there are any questions, or if I made any errors. I'll consider any requests as well!

I'm an MMA fan but don't actively train in MMA.  

Most sports/hobbies/jobs exist on a skillset that has a linear evolution.  For example, I am a piano player.  I started when I was 6 years old and even then when I was playing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, it was basically the same general thing I do now playing a Beethoven sonata.  The years, time, effort, practice, etc. never had a massive gulf or huge hurdle placed in the middle of it that I had to overcome...most things are like this.

With MMA, or any combat sport really, I have always felt like there was this huge gulf that at some point had to be bridged before you could continue with this...to me, that gulf has always seemed like getting full on punched in the face, beaten up, or for lack of a better term, actually ""doing"" real MMA as opposed to training it.

For a while about two years ago I trained at a Muay Thai gym just out of curiosity more than anything else and to try something new.  I had a lot of fun and it is a hell of a work out.  It was a real gym with active fighters, but 95% of the people there just seemed like people exercising and I couldn't really ever see most of them competing in any real combat.  I was never really around on the weekends when they did the fighter training.

So, I guess the question I'm curious about today is how do people who actually intend to compete in real combat sports make that jump from training in it, to actually fighting?  I understand the whole concept of sparring, but at what point does someone actually fight someone with all of the implications that brings?  Is it the actual first amateur bout, or at some point will a fighter get domed in the face for the first time at their home gym?  

I've always wondered about that massive gulf that seems to exist in this sport and would be curious to hear some stories.",From Training To Fighting - That Gulf,0,1

&gt;UFC controls most of the MMA landscape, and when it feels threatened by another organization, they buy it out. I know the other organization doesn’t have to sell necessarily, but the UFC tries and usually succeeds.

&gt;The main reason boxing pays so much is because boxers have OPTIONS. They have at least 4 big promotions at all times that will compete with one another to pay the fighters the most money in order to acquire the fighter under contract.

&gt;Basically, UFC fighters have little to no options because the UFC operates like a monopoly in order to keep fighter pay low. Buying out other promotions is much more worth it if they can keep fighter pay low and acquire almost all MMA fighters that are worth having.

What’s the pros and cons to wearing a brass knuckle in a MMA fight like shown in this video? Do you think all figjters should be allowed to wield knives in a MMA fighf? 

Interesting, what if a fighter simply uses a grenade during a MMA fight? what about chemical weapons? Is it allowed to smoke in the ring? 

Should MMA fighters bring pepper spray for self defense durinh MmA fights? I think pepper sprays are  bonus, and so do you!

In the interest of contributing more to this subreddit that just cheap jokes and memes, I watched a bunch of Leon Edwards fights so you don’t have to. 

Hello and welcome to the Kickie Punchie Report – Leon Edwards

**Too Long; Won’t Read** – Leon Edwards is really good at a lot of the less exciting and obvious aspects of the game such as Footwork, Distance Management, Load Management and Risk Management. (Leon ""Karen"" Edwards would like to speak to your MMA management)  MMA is wild but I do think he will beat Nate Diaz. 

**What did I watch?** His last 7 wins against Albert Tumenov, Vicente Luque, Bryan Barberena, Peter Sobotta, Donald Cerrone, Gunnar Nelson, Rafael Dos Anjos. His losses to Claudio Silva and Kamaru Usman and his no contest against Belal Muhammad.

**What is Leon good at?** Footwork, distance management, risk management and load management are Leon’s real keys to success. Leon is great at dictating when and where the fight will take place. His footwork allows him to consistently get the fight to take place where the fight will take place and his distant management means that the fight will take place when he wants the fight to take place. A great display of that is the Cowboy fight where Cowboy is trying to do everything he can to rush in and tag Leon but Leon’s superior footwork and distance management means Edwards is far outside of Cowboy’s reach when he starts throwing. 

What can make Edwards fights a bit tedious (especially when you watch five in a day) is that he is incredibly risk adverse. Not to say that as an insult but Leon knows exactly what he needs to do to win. He’s incredibly aware of when he is in the lead and won’t divert from the game plan and create an opening that will give his opponents a change. When Leon is confident that he is winning will choose to take his foot off the gas and focus on limiting the opportunities his opponent has to land a big shot and build momentum. 

Leon isn’t a high volume striker to begin with choosing to mix it up with a variety of different single strikes. He has a great jab, body kicks and a clean 1-2 but he doesn’t get caught in long exchanges, choosing instead to exit and circle out until he chooses to reengage or switch to grappling.

Edwards loves tying fighters up against the cage where he uses great knees to stifle their defense before tripping them down and working for position. Leon does not care about going for the finish or even doing damage and this is crucial to his success. Leon is there to win the fight and won’t risk a clean cut decision for a finish. The two finishes that he has in his last 7 wins both came in the final round with the only TKO coming in the last second of the round. That is his load management on display. He could get the finish but Leon’s game is built on having enough in the tank to fuel winning the footwork battle while standing and having the strength and endurance to win position on the ground. Which is all Leon cares about on the ground. He gets the dominate position keeps it for as long as the fighter and the ref will allow him and racks up control time on the score cards throwing the bare minimum of strikes to stop the fighter from improving his position or the ref from standing them up. 

And that is really Leon Edwards’ game plan. Take the center of the cage, establish the treat of strikes and win the round standing while not getting caught in risk exchanges, lure the opponent to the cage, clinch, move to the cage get the fighter down and rack up control time in dominate position until the fight is up.

It’s not the most sensational game plan but the fact that Leon can consistently able to pull it off shows how skilled Leon is. When you know what you’re opponent is going to do, you spend a whole fight camp trying to prevent him from doing it and he does it anyways, that’s talent. 

**Why does he lose?** What gives Leon trouble is explosive fighters that can negate his superior footwork. His split decision win over Gunnar Nelson shows that as Gunnar’s karate stance and footwork allowed him to cover the distance quickly and forced a much different approach from Leon with the fight becoming more of a counter striker showdown with them standing right in front of each other often waiting for the other to make the first mistake. Thankfully Leon refined that brutal elbow on the clinch break that dropped Gunnar in the second. 

Leon has been accused of having suspect cardio, I could definitely see moments earlier in his UFC career when he was huffing and puffing between rounds but that was usually the case after grappling heavy rounds and might be a symptom of using more strength then technique which he has since seemed to improve.

Claudio Silva was able to win thanks to him just being a strong durable thicky boi that could barrel in and each punches in order to get inside and out muscle Leon in grappling exchanges. 

Usman’s pressure was insane destroying Leon’s footwork advantage and having the obvious strength and wrestling advantage. 

**Can he beat Nate?** MMA is wild so don’t be surprised……mutherfuckers but yes. Nate has great cardio, walks fighters down and defiantly has the durability to eat shots to enter but the problem is that Leon has the footwork advantage and I don’t think Nate will be able to walk him down and corner him to rack up punches on him. Add to that Nate has more scar tissue then brain tissue at this point and Leon’s elbows off the clinch are brutal. He really starred to perfect them around the Gunner fight dropping and cutting him as well as Cowboy and the doctor was called in for a nasty gash Leon opened up on RDA. Nate does have a 2 inch reach advantage and is a southpaw but so is Leon and he is comfortable switching stances to give Nate plenty of different looks. Them both being southpaws means it will be harder for Nate to defend against those little baby leg kicks. The smaller cage for the Belal fight seemed like it pushed Leon to pick up the pace and engage more frequently but that could also of been Leon coming back after 2 years and really wanting to have a stand out performance but the bigger cage he’ll be fighting Nate in means he’ll have plenty of room to avoid the Stockton Slap.

I’m sure Nate will get a first round flying knee KO just so the MMA Gods can rub their balls in my face. 

With that said, that concludes today's Kickie Punchie Report. 

I’ll probably do one again on either Wonderboy or Gilbert Burns before UFC 264. Hope you goofs enjoyed this.

Since there was interest in that post, thought I'd expand to include some of the GOAT candidates some of you thought I should have included. This time, I added to the list Fedor, Aldo, DJ, Nunes, and Penn. 

In case you didn't see it last time, the methodology works like this; I added all the wins, losses, and draws (did not include NCs) of every opponent the GOAT candidate beat. Then I did the same for every opponent they lost to or drew against. In each category I divided the wins by the total fights to get the winning percentage of all opponents by category. Then I divided the total wins of all opponents by the total fights all of their opponents had. 

For instances where the opponent was fought more than once, I included them as many times. As an example, BJ Penn beat Matt Hughes twice and lost to him once. Hughes' record was counted twice in the numbers for opponents BJ Penn has beaten and once for opponents he lost to. Hughes was counted three times for the total percentage. 

I'll link to the spreadsheet below, but if you just want to know the highest/lowest in each category, they are as follows

Opponents beaten highest = Nunes (.713) 
Opponents beaten lowest = Khabib (.637)

Opponents lost to highest = Aldo (.815)
Opponents lost to lowest = Nunes (.541)

Draws = (Only DJ and Penn had draws, Penn was higher at .643 to DJ's .619)

Total opponents highest = DJ
Total opponents lowest = Khabib

I was thinking of rounding this out with 5 more if there's interest. Had it in mind to include Shev, Holloway, Cyborg, Sakuraba, and Gracie. I'd be happy to take suggestions if anyone thinks there are better candidates. Also would be happy to do another such project about different statistics if anyone has any in mind. Also open to working with someone else if anyone's open to it.

* place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
* write a haiku
* draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing or haiku are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

Used to do this a lot as a teenager. Getting back into it but obviously like most people, I struggling a lot with flexibility. 

I noticed that my hamstrings are quite flexible with the ability to stretch my hands round to my heel and get my nose to my knee. We do a warm up which had the splits involved, my groin and hamstrings can take the strain, but my hip just can’t go any wider than 90 degrees. Really sharp pain in the sides

Noticed yesterday when doing a lead body hight roundhouse, my hip just can take the drain of lifting my leg off the floor. Come doing a reverse roundhouse, because of the momentum (i suspect), there’s power and little to no pain. 

Wondering if anyone has overcome this hip tightness? Any resources? 

Thanks.",Hip flexibility. Sharp pain during no momentum roundhouse or sidekick,14,1

But he said he thinks Leon is his toughest Colby and Burns are about an even second place. I asked him about WB and he chuckled and said something like..."" I like WB, he is a good guy, I've trained with him a few times, I don't think his fans want to see that fight"". He didn't go into details and I just grabbed my food and left because other people wanted to talk to him. I think he is able to take WB down at will tbh, but WB has good distance control.

&gt;Brandon Moreno’s cornerman and UFC fighter Marcelo Rojo sparked controversy two days before his friend’s title rematch with flyweight champion Deiveson Figueiredo at UFC 263 in Glendale, AZ, with a few posts on social media.

&gt;Rojo posted a series of pictures on his Instagram page with a filter that gave Figueiredo a monkey face. Calling Brazilians “monkeys” are a racist insult usually seen in the soccer world for decades in Rojo’s home country of Argentina, and it drew outrage from Figueiredo’s team. Wallid Ismail, manager for the champion, posted the images on his social media calling for “every racist” to be “banned from the sport.”

&gt;Rojo, who set his Instagram page private after the controversy began, opened it up again hours later with a statement in Portuguese in which he apologized “for offending people yesterday, which wasn’t the intention.”

&gt;Speaking with MMA Fighting on Saturday, Rojo said he wasn’t aware that those filters could have a racist implication in Brazil.

&gt;""I apologize to everybody, to people I don’t even know,” Rojo wrote in a text message. “Wallid is making this bigger than it is, I was just was putting filters on the [Instagram] live. I put a lot to all the fighters, I use the baby Yoda, the mustache filter, the monkey, on every fighter in the press conference, we were joking around… Then [Figueiredo] push Brandon and we start shouting, and someone screenshot the live and pass me the image. I upload it for fun, to make jokes to get [Figueiredo] more angry than he already is, but not to make this a racist thing.

&gt;“I do not know Brazil history, I’m from Argentina but I hate [soccer], I never watch an entire game, I did not know that was a real offense to the Brazilian people. I make a big mistake and regret it. I apologize to the people, I apologize to Wallid, I even apologize to master Rafael Cordeiro who I know him, who train me six months, and he explained it to me. Also, this is nothing to do with the Argentinian president, I am not living in Argentina since 2015. It was al a big mistake. In Mexico we joke around every time like this and it’s a big cultural gap that I missed. And I’m sorry again.”","UFC fighter Marcelo Rojo apologizes for racist posts; Dana White, Brandon Moreno disapprove",80,1

He has faced very mediocre fighters and when he got booked in what was a very hyped up fight against Paul Daley, it was an absolute snoozefest. When page got his big fight against Lima it became his first true test, and he failed. Page was spectacularly knocked out, in fact he was so spectacularly knocked out that people dont even remember the actual fight. Page pieced lima up in the first and rocked him but he made a big mistake and got brutally KO'd.

If you read into Page's career it is absolutely spectacular, Page is a 10 time Kickboxing world champion, And competed at many different weight classes. Of course many people have criticized Page for his style, as he showboats a lot and leaves his guard down, but despite the showboating, Page is still one of the best strikers in the entirety of bellator. Page's ground game is nothing spectacular but it gets the job done.

I know people are going to immediately start calling me a MVP fanboy for this post, but i firmly believe that he could compete amongst some ranked ufc welterweights, of course i don't think he would beat top tier fighters like Usman, Covington, or Wonderboy but i believe he would be able to compete with some lower ones like Neil Magny and Santiago Ponzinibbio.",I understand why people dont like MVP but he is a serious talent,8,1

So I see it getting to that point, but jamahl was definitely not alright with that thing flopping around. 

&amp;nbsp;

I think of the Sylvia v Mir fight when there is a break. Herb dean stopped it and Sylvia protested but has come around to say he’s glad he did now. Most of the time a break is a fight ender but is that on the ref to protect the fighter at that point or should the fighter tap?  Obviously the ref can make the final decision as if they stop it then it’s done. What do the rules say in those instances though?  Was that new ref tonight actually wrong?

So, after a night full of attitude, let’s go through who should fight who in the future. Also, if I say anything loopy, forgive me, I’m super tired and I’m seeing things. Lol.

QUICK ROUNDS

Movsar Evloev: Bryce Mitchell. A fantastic grappling matchup here. Will be interesting to see how they approach this one.

Lauren Murphy: Valentina Shevchenko. Fuck it. A +700 underdog for Shevchenko gotta be out there somewhere.

Brad Riddell: Gregor Gillespie. With Diego Ferreira’s recent losing streak, and Kevin Lee’s plans on moving to Welterweight, Brad Riddell could be right at the front door of the Top 10. Also, these two were supposed to fight, so this looks pretty good now.

THE BIG ONES

* Paul Craig vs Jamahal Hill

RESULT: Paul Craig defeats Jamahal Hill in Round 1 via TKO/Submission/what the fuck was that

Paul Craig: Nikita Krylov

Jamahal Hill: Jim Crute

I know they say luck of the Irish, but Scottish is pretty damn close. Walking in as a +240 underdog, the Bear Jew just cashed in with an upset over previously unbeaten Jamahal Hill, getting a brutal armbar in just under two minutes. I figured that the winner of this matchup would get a shot at the top 10, and we’ve got one with Paul Craig. Scotland’s biggest male export is now 4-0-1 in his last 5, justifying a move into the top 10, with Ukraine’s Nikita Krylov. It’ll be an epic battle of submission artists, and the winner will be one that puts the entire division on notice. As for Jamahal Hill, a pairing with Jim Crute, who just lost while getting injured, makes plenty of sense. Hill and Crute is a phenomenal fight, and as soon as both men are healthy, let the madness ensue. I wish the best for Hill and Johore for a full, and safe recovery.

* Demian Maia vs Belal Muhammad

Belal Muhammad: Loser of Burns-Thompson

Demian Maia: ???

Belal Muhammad received a nice consolation prize for his Leon Edwards fiasco, and captured a spot in the welterweight top 10. Belal’s incredible takedown defense was the story of the fight, as he just would. not. go. down. at. all. He’s a legit guy, and with some standup work, he can become a problem. As for Maia, who knows. He might fight Ponzinnibio, or he might retire because he is in fact 43 years old. Regardless, Maia is a future HOF member, and one of the best submission artists. I wish both men the best in their futures.

* Leon Edwards vs Nate Diaz

Leon Edwards: Winner of Usman-Covington II

Nate Diaz: Tony Ferguson or Loser of Poirier-McGregor III

The 5 round non-title, non-main event is a groundbreaking idea for the UFC. Think about the possibilities with this shit. Jorge-Nick for 5 rounds for the BMF belt, Zhang-Joanna II, Tony-Nate, do you see where I’m coming from? We just broke on to something new, and the fight wouldn’t have been as crazy if it were three rounds, now wouldn’t it? As for the fight, Leon may have won 49-46 in reality, but Nate won 50-40 in our hearts. Leon has had a really really tedious run of bad luck, and it almost hit him again in the last minute. Since this guy has been through so much, and also because Dana said so, Leon is finally getting that title shot. I think Kamaru and Colby will fight in September, and maybe the winner will get Leon this December if we are fortunate. It’s time to give this dude his recognition. And as for the man of the night, the one and only Nate Diaz. Yes one half of the NDA leadership nearly broke the simulation and almost KO’d Leon Edwards in the last minute. Nate came close to Stockton slapping Live betting odds with that overhand, but Leon prevailed, earning the UD. Now that Nate is back in the business like Michael De Santa in GTA 5, we might be in store for a money fight. Nate and Tony Ferguson absolutely need to fight, and if we never see it, then our lives will have never reached their full potential. It just needs to happen. Any where, any weight, any time, and it most abso-fucking-lutely better be 5 rounds, motherfucker. Or, we get the loser of Poirier-McGregor III, and get a trilogy with Conor and Nate, or Nate and Dustin, the 2018 bout that got away. Either one is a slam dunk, and the UFC should really consider it.

* Deiveson Figueiredo vs Brandon Moreno II

Brandon Moreno: Askar Askarov

Deiveson Figueiredo: Cody Garbrandt

Brandon Moreno has finally given Mexico it’s first champion. In one of the biggest cultural moments in the UFC, Brandon Moreno stopped Deiveson Figueiredo in Round 3 with a rear naked choke, after beating Figueiredo in every facet of the game for the first 2 rounds. Moreno is on the right side of 30, and he could be the long-term champ star that the UFC needs in Latin America. For his first defense, Moreno should rematch with Askar Askarov, an undefeated Russian who went to a draw with Moreno back in 2019. Since the draw, Askarov has been 3-0, with wins over Tim Elliott, Alexandre Pantoja, and Joseph Benavidez. This rematch should be booked for possibly October. Then we have Deiveson Figueiredo, who couldn’t answer any of the adjustments that Moreno made from the first fight. At 33 years of age, Figueiredo will have some time to regain the throne, and since his record against Moreno is 0-1-1, rather than 0-2, a trilogy fight in the future is justifiable. But Figgy will need to earn it, and what better way to earn it, than to fight Cody Garbrandt, the former bantamweight champion who was scheduled to face Figueiredo last November, but his bicep injury literally changed EVERYTHING. Now that the stakes are different, with Cody being 1-4 in his last five, most recently losing to Rob Font, then maybe a change in weight is necessary. Figueiredo-Garbrandt has always had a ring to it as a fun fight, and October sounds like an appropriate time to make this one happen.

* Israel Adesanya vs Marvin Vettori II

Israel Adesanya: Robert Whittaker

Marvin Vettori: Loser of Brunson-Till

It’s time for another installment of “I Fucked His Leg Up” with your host, Israel Adesanya. In his anticipated rematch with Italy’s Marvin Vettori (who definitely doesn’t look like Benito Mussolini), The Last Stylebender pitched a complete shutout en route to his third title defense. Adesanya had iffy takedown defense throughout the fight, but Vettori was eventually worn down, and luckily for him, he avoided that attempted Paulo Costa foreshadowing at the end of the 4th round (IYKYK). Well, it’s time for Adesanya to get that rematch, and face a newly motivated Robert Whittaker, and I’m personally shooting for October on this one, maybe we’ll get this in Auckland like Adesanya wants. As for Vettori, well what I saw was a new person, who made the same old mistakes. He didn’t switch up his striking game, and every time he engaged with Adesanya, it was the same southpaw combo that Adesanya avoided essentially every time. Despite his success with grappling earlier, he was worn down, and swept on the judges scoring cards. The next opponent for Vettori should be the loser of Brunson-Till, a 185 matchup going down this August. Either won is a good one for Vettori. He was supposed to fight Till in April, and Brunson’s grappling could cancel his out, and test his striking. Any who, Vettori still has a ways to go if he wants to become champ one day.

Custom flairs: here are three ways to obtain a custom flair:

* place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
* write a haiku
* draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing or haiku are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

At the time of the fight, Fedor's opponents have a combined **663-245-25,** which is a **.710** win percentage. Since fighting Fedor, their combined records are **279-283-2**, which is a **.478** win percentage. Combined, they have a **942-528-27** record, which is a **.629** win percentage. 

For further context, I decided to do the same for Fedor's pride fights. On the data sheet included below, I bracketed those fights out specifically. The records of Fedor's Pride opponents when they fought Fedor are **215-74-8**, which is a **.723** win percentage.  Since fighting Fedor they have a combined **96-106-1** record, which is a **.472** win percentage. In total, Fedor's Pride opponents have a **311-180-9** combined record, which is a **.622** win percentage. 

Obviously, this is not the end all be all for stats or arguments when it comes to the challenges Fedor faced in his career, but it could be one useful data point for that discussion. If nothing else I hope this is fun and interesting. Would love to hear any feedback and any ideas about what sort of data would be interesting to learn about. I'm thinking of doing Fedor's total cage time over his career and breaking it down by TKO, Dub, and Decision wins and losses. Hope everyone enjoys this!

That being said he's also made it obvious that he doesn't like when fighters choose to sit out in the guise of 'we'll move on without them' when they clearly want that specific fight but will settle for someone cheaper (ie Nganou/Lewis over Nganou/Jones because of $).

Now I'm not advocating that fighters shouldn't do what they feel is right, but I feel like a win-win for everyone would be to implement a multi-tiered bonus system for fighter acitivty per year. We all know each contract involves the must have 3-fight offer clause, but if they incentivized it with a pay bonus multiplier - I guarentee more fighters would fight more often, especially high ranked fighters who aren't super popular.

Here is a rough example:

Fighter A (#12 Ranked In Division)

First Fight Of 2021:

- Pay To Show - 125,000$
- Pay to Win - 125,000$
- Standard Bonuses Apply (perf. of the night, sub/ko, etc)
- No Activity Bonus

Second Fight Of 2021:

- Pay To Show - 125,000$
- Pay to Win - 125,000$
- Standard Bonuses Apply (perf. of the night, sub/ko, etc)
- 2nd Fight Activity Bonus +50,000$

Third Fight Of 2021:

- Pay To Show - 125,000$
- Pay to Win - 125,000$
- Standard Bonuses Apply (perf. of the night, sub/ko, etc)
- 3rd Fight Activity Bonus +75,000$

Fourth Fight Of 2021:

- Pay To Show - 125,000$
- Pay to Win - 125,000$
- Standard Bonuses Apply (perf. of the night, sub/ko, etc)
- 4th Fight Activity Bonus +100,000$

Fifth Fight Of 2021:

- Pay To Show - 125,000$
- Pay to Win - 125,000$
- Standard Bonuses Apply (perf. of the night, sub/ko, etc)
- 5th Fight Activity Bonus +125,000$

(Activity bonus capped after the 3rd fight would be more likely but you get the idea).

This way fighters would be more incentivized ro fight when they can, fight down the rankings, step in on short notice, take riskier fights, etc - simply due to the fact that the sting of losing is softened from the extra chunk of money rewarded for staying active. I'm honestly shocked they haven't done this already.",The UFC should absolutely implement an 'Activity' bonus for fighters.,521,677

[Made a short video about this for my YouTube channel for anyone that would rather hear me explain it in a bit more depth.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9EYi-vLBSIzyatsaJEXq_Q) If not, read on!

I added up the total time of all 45 of his fights (not including 1 NC) by seconds and calculated the total minutes and hours as well. I averaged all of those out across his 45 fights and included the results as well. Lastly, I found the totals and the averages by his wins and losses and further broke those down by type (TKO/KO, Sub, Decision).

Over the course of his career Fedor has spent 15,016 seconds in the cage, which is equivalent to 250 minutes and 16 seconds, or 4 hours, 10 minutes, and 16 seconds. That's 333.6 seconds per fight, which is 5 minutes 33.6 seconds, just over a round.

It took Fedor on average 3 minutes and 24 seconds to finish an opponent by TKO/KO, 3 minutes and 27 seconds to finish an opponent by submission. It took him on average about 3 minutes and 14 seconds to be finished by TKO/KO, and it took 1:06 seconds for his only submission loss.

If anyone wants to take the effort to look at the data and correct whatever I've gotten wrong, I'd appreciate it. I may have made some rounding errors or misread some things, and I'm happy to be corrected. [You can find the data here.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19_5J17fp_S6HGSi1uihY7HtQN_MH29qRRoLXUoSHT3Y/edit#gid=0)

Hope everyone enjoys! Would love to hear any ideas about other stuff I could potentially research that would be interesting.","Fedor's Career Cage Time, Per Fight Cage Time, with Data Further Broken Down by Wins/Losses",92,37

This time, as the title says, I gathered the win percentages of Jose Aldo's opponents when they fought him and since they fought him. 

If you haven't seen my other posts, I'll point out that I do not include NCs in the calculations, though I make note of them. I include the results of the fight with Aldo in the ""since they fought"" section. For instance, Kenny Florian was 14-5 heading into the fight with Aldo, which was his last, and lost. Therefore, he is 0-1 ""since"" that fight. 

The results are pretty interesting. All the data is in the spreadsheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TbR4dy-7XExc1qGZzGZcn1Pz1JHOcL6zOFONbr19ITg/edit#gid=0) if anyone's interested, but I'll include the totals in this post. His career opponents win records/percentages when they fought are **446-111-10 (.786).** Since they fought the numbers are **179-168-4 (.509),** and the total is **625-279-14 (.680).** 

I also decided to specifically include his time fighting for and holding the FW title since that was likely the toughest stretch of his career and when he was really at the pinnacle of his ability. It's a total of 14 fights from when he won the WEC FW title from Mike Brown to when he challenged for the UFC FW title for the last time in the Max Holloway rematch. The results are **231-45-2 (.830)** for opponent win percentage at the time of the fight, **65-62 (.511)** for opponent win percentage since the fight, and a grand total of **296-107-2 (.730)** for those opponents careers.

As always, happy to make any corrections for any mistakes I may have made if anyone spots any. Would also love to hear any suggestions anyone has for more kinds of data gathering, be it for another fighter for this sort of thing or for another category entirely. I'm thinking of doing GSP next, and maybe doing some MMA legends who weren't quite GOATs, like Bisping or Overeem. Hope you enjoy!

I'm genuinely curious as to how low paid athletes can bypass one of the most hardcore stringiest 3rd party drug testing organizations in the world especially when its ""random"" tests. Quote me if I'm wrong but USADA is the Olympic standard of drug testing? Anyone and everyone whos ever used PEDs in the Olympics gets popped eventually. I've heard rumors from guys at gyms that fighters use low doses of Testosterone Propionate a week broken into into daily injections. Reasoning behind daily injections and using Propionate is because they cause a much shorter half life so it becomes virtually undetectable.

Where do they find these translators who don’t even translate the question or answer properly.  Apparently the translator just made a bunch of shit up as she went and wasn’t even aware of what a title fight was which led to a strange response back from KZ.

It’s hard to grow fans for international fighters/champions when they constantly butcher the translations or misinterpret what the fighters are saying.  How can a billionaire dollar company not afford to hire a Korean translator who can translate both ways when the main event is a fighter who can’t speak English well.","If uncle Dana and the UFC don’t want to pay their fighters more, the least they can do is hire a legitimate translate who can actually translate…",65,52

Is there any mental technique that you can apply when you're hurt in a fight? For example saying stuff like ""don't give up!"" or ""no pain"" to yourself is helpful? Is there any way of ignoring pain? Maybe focusing on winning the fight and not on the pain itself?

I thought I’d share and see if others agreed with my list for the top five winners and losers of the week. This list is not necessarily if an underdog wins or a favorite loses. This list won’t put a heavy favorite who won as the biggest winner even if they won in spectacular fashion, but instead tries to encompass an overall aspect of their performance from multiple angles such as history, expectations, and future.

TLDR at the bottom with the full rankings for people who don’t want to read it all

Top Five Losers

5. Kanako Murata 

Murata came in as a slight underdog, but talk around reddit and twitter was that this could be a nice little upset on the card with Murata’s grappling skills and the fact she has not lost since 2016. Well, that changed tonight in a gruesome way. In the fight, Murata was caught in a nasty armbar, and with about 3 minutes left in the fight, Murata’s left arm gave out. Like it was bad, she could not even lift it to defend herself. Murata then proceeded to take 3 minutes of shots from Jandiroba before a doctor stoppage between round ended the fight. Murata scores points for toughing it out through the pain absolutely; but to have a fight end like that is not what you ever want to see.

4. Lima Brothers

Way Way back in February of 2007, Matt Brown secured his 6th professional win (3rd by KO) and won the ICSF East Caot Welterweight championship (Thanks wikipedia) against a future Bellator champion. Tonight, 14 years later, Matt Brown knocks out Dhiego Lima, the brother of Douglas Lima, who Brown knocked out all those years ago. It doesn’t help that Lima was a decent-sized favorite, as well as Brown riding a 2 loss streak going into age 40, but Matt Brown came and showed them that he’s the Daddy of the family. 

3.  Dan Ige

I’m sure on other places and sites, articles will write that Ige was the biggest loser of the fight. He essentially got dominated for 2 or 3 of the 5 rounds and struggled the other rounds, and although I agree this loss derails his momentum, especially in a stacked division, there are some bright spots for this fight along with bigger losers puts him reluctantly at 3. Although not the biggest favorite to lose, this was the moment for Ige to shine after a beautiful KO of Gavin Tucker earlier this year, and for the second time in one year, the five round limelight was too bright. Ige was however able to rock Zombie a few times and showed that even in the fifth round he was not afraid to go out swinging, but in a division that now has contenders from #1-#5 as well as some new blood rising, Ige is not in a good position. 

2.  Alexey Oleynik

59-16-1. A legendary MMA record, but since starting in the UFC in 2014 (and fighting in 15 fights), Oleynik only has 8 wins to show for it. Now granted, no one should have expected a different result. Oleynik was one of the biggest underdogs of the fight and now has lost 3 straight fights and looked absolutely gassed in the third round of the fight. Oleynik fought bravely, and Spivac was also tired by the end of the fight, but the Oleynik will be turning 44 next week and will now officially drop out of the rankings. Chasing that elusive 60th win, the question is how much longer will he fight, as leaving on a high note is now almost virtually impossible. This second place ranking is not so much about the fight as you can tell, but more about the legacy of a great submission artist who now looks like he doesn’t belong in the octagon. 

1. Aleksa Camur

Usually the number 1 spot is reserved for a flashy loss, where the heavy favorite gets knocked out, or something brutal happens, but tonight was filled with a whole lot of winners, and Camur takes the number one spot because he couldn’t be flashy. Although it was an entertaining fight, Camur was just not able to knock his opponent down. Nicola “Nick” Negumereanu ws just eating Camur’s bombs and survived by pinning Camur against the fence and throwing his own punches. And it’s not for a lack of trying, Camur was throwing some heavy hits out, but the strength and speed of Nick was just a little too much. As one of the biggest favorites, Camur wasn’t able to pull out a UFC win and is dropped to 0-2 in the UFC after a decision loss to William Knight. With the second loss, being a favorite, and just not being able to get anything done versus an underdog, Camur gets the number 1 position.

Top 6 Winners

6. Seung Woo Choi

This fight card actually was so good, that we are doing top 6 winners because it was really hard to pick just 5. Choi comes in at 6 though, even with a great victory, only because the winners ranked above him had phenomenal performances. But don’t let that discount Choi’s first round finish of Erosa, who was only a slight underdog. Choi started his UFC career with two straight loses to Evloev and Gavin Tucker, which are tough in their own right, but has now rallied off three straight wins. Choi won performance of the night and South Korea should be proud now as two south Koreans are going to be ranked in the Featherweight division. 

5. Bruno Silva

What a way to kick off a UFC career. Silva, fresh off a M-1 championship, was another one of those picks that threads wanted to bet against due to his newcomer status and questions about the transition from lower tier competition to the UFC. There are no questions anymore. Although Turman wasn’t exactly the cream of the crop, Turman was able to get some “half” takedowns that were defended well by Silva. The two fighters had a solid back and forth round before Silva just put Turman to sleep wit ha ground and pound, like dude was completely out. Silva had a great debut, and he comes in at number 5

4. Casey O’Neill

7-0. The only undefeated fighter on the card, Casey O’Neill is two for two in the UFC. Although the fight wasn’t pretty, the 3rd round submission still counts as a solid win. Coming in as an underdog, O’neill got the job done after a grueling fight where both fighters left it all out on the mat. O’Neill is heading for a bright future as she now has shown she has some grappling and submission skills in her kit as well as the ability to KO her opponent.

3. Rick Glenn

Glenn had not fought since November of 2018, and came in as a slight underdog against an 11-3 Silva. But in 37 seconds, the 32 year old recorded his first KO SINCE 2016. That is crazy and no one would have expected a fighter who has gone the distance in all of his UFC fights to record his first knockout tonight. This isn’t even knock to Silva, because Glenn was just so smooth with his strikes and was patient and just caught silva with a beautiful punch. Glenn was poised, quick, and effective in his follow up strikes that ended the fight early. 

2. Korean Zombie 

Since 2012, The Korean Zombie was headlined every fight card he has participated in (There was a break from 2014 to 2017 due to military service in South Korea). The limelight doesn’t scare him, and frankly not much does. Although being 4-3 in his main event fights, Korean Zombie fights like a champ, giving it all and becoming a huge fan favorite. This fight against Ige, however, was a massive test as the Featherweight division has increasingly become stacked, (and staggered due to the delay for the Volk vs Ortega fight), which meant that he needed a win here to remain in contention for the belt. Although Zombie absolutely won this fight, no doubt Ige gave it his all and the strength of zombie shined here. He was able to showcase his whole arsenal, from punches to kicks to takedowns to grappling, Korean Zombie showed fans that he is able to compete and any fighter coming for him next has a lot of prep to do if they want to take down The Korean Zombie.

1. Matt Brown

You can absolutely make an argument for Zombie as the biggest winner here, but lets be real, the moment the 40 year old knocked out Lima, he was going straight to the top of the rankings. Coming of two straight UFC loses, Matt Brown showed that he still has plenty of fight in him. With the added bonus of now knocking out both Lima brothers, and the nice check for performance of the night, Brown lived up to his “Immortal” nickname.",Top Five Winners and Losers UFC Vegas 29 6/19/2021,55,0

**Result:**

Israel Adesanya defeats Marvin Vettori by Unanimous Decision (50-45x3)

&amp;#x200B;

**Major Points:**

	1. Vettori's gameplan and adjustments 

	2. Overall striking

	3. Overall wrestling/grappling

	4. Adesanya striking patterns

	5. Overall takeaways regarding each fighter and their futures

&amp;#x200B;

**Vettori Gameplan &amp; Adjustments:**

	Vettori's gameplan coming into this fight had to look very similar to the 3rd round of his first bout with Adesanya and the 4th and 5th rounds of Blachowicz's, get Adesanya to the ground, flatten him out, and control him there while landing enough ground and pound to avoid a stand up. I don’t know what Vettori was thinking but he clearly just could not execute that plan at all. One of the most drastic differences I noticed in this fight was the speed difference between Adesanya and Vettori, Vettori just moves extremely slow in every department compared to Adesanya. On top of this, he doesn't even compensate with exceptional strength. Going off what we saw in the fight, moments like when Adesanya was able to use an overhook and just brutishly turn Marvin around and escape suggest that he may not have even been the strongest man in the cage. And you can see how big of an advantage this is for Adesanya when Vettori shoots. Izzy can go from his natural striking stance (feet even, weight leaned somewhat backwards), to an excellent wrestling stance (hips squared, weight low, and hands outstretched) before Marvin can even make contact. On one particularly sad shot in I believe the 4th, Adesanya has double wrist control as soon as Vettori touches him because he had ample time to get in a perfect stance and prepare for the stance. This was the shot where Adesanya was clowning on him by slapping his butt. And it's no surprise because Marvin just kept doing this OVER and OVER. It's no wonder Izzy just got more and more comfortable in the octagon as the fight went on. Based on how angry Marvin's coach, Rafael Cordeiro, was in the corner between rounds it seems possible that Vettori was not following the gameplan his team had laid out for him or was not making any of the adjustments asked of him. I personally tend to believe the latter since it was painfully obvious that Vettori was just doing the same thing over and over. Even in the 5th round, which will likely be the last time we will ever see him in the ring with Izzy he showed nothing new, just meaningless takedown attempts, incredible durability, and some functional striking. Which brings us to our next point, Vettori's headhunting. Vettori seemed to forget that Adesanya is an incredible striker, and was just winging punches at his head for the entirety of the stand up. He almost never threw a strike to the body and displayed a kicking game reminiscent of Kyle Bochniak. He made no attempts to change anything up, save for a few half decent leg kicks. 

	

**Striking Observations:**

	The striking went about as we all expected it to, a complete outclassing by Adesanya. The footwork was really interesting to watch, especially as someone who is just learning how important footwork is and the basics of it all. Adesanya constantly seemed to be dictating where the fight was held, whether that be in the center of the octagon or along the cage wall. Now while it seems quite ill-advised to want the fight near the edge of the cage one idea I can think of was that Adesanya did not want to risk being taken down in open space. As we all know, Adesanya's takedown defense along the cage is exceptional, while in open space it is significantly more suspect. Izzy may have felt that he had such an advantage striking that he could beat Marvin with his back to the cage, which he did. Vettori honestly made a respectable showing of himself on the feet. He showcased a functional jab that he landed fairly often and attempted cage cutting, a clear step up from Adesanya's last title contender, Paulo Costa. Adesanya's inhuman ability to lean backwards to an extreme degree while maintaining his balance showed itself in this fight again, albeit in a much more muted capacity due to the positioning of the fight. Vettori was clearly frustrated by this, which often resulted in him simply bull rushing Adesanya. Who then simply circled around and reset back in the center or wherever he chose to. This pattern actually repeats itself rather frequently: Both in southpaw, Marvin throws a 1-2, Adesanya simply leans back with little foot movement, Vettori charges forward continuing to throw 1-2s, Adesanya circles around and they reengage. Adesanya's head movement in this fight would have made Edmond Tarverdyan proud, although this was likely a product of Vettori's slowness and telegraphed strikes. Also of note, Adesanya frequently circled to Vettori's power side, showing his (righteous) lack of respect for Vettori's power and striking ability. Adesanya used a rear leg feint/kick from orthodox to transition to a rear leg calf kick from southpaw over and over. Vettori just never seems to pick up on it, got hit with it more and more as the fight went on. Adesanya really picked it up in the 3rd round, landing his most strikes and showing some beautiful ground work with the reversals and RNC defense. Izzy really started to pick up the calf kicks in the third, even scoring a knockdown with one. Vettori's mobility for the rest of the fight was clearly affected by it. Despite the fact that Adesanya was against the cage for most of this fight we actually were able to see a nice display of cage cutting ability from Adesanya. He uses his stance switching to create some very interesting angles that he used to herd Vettori. 

	

**Wrestling/Ground Game:**

	The time on the ground started off fairly well for Vettori but once again he just couldn't get the fight there enough. That opening takedown was beautifully timed from Vettori and gave me some initial hope, but Adesanya was able to get his butt right on over to the cage and get up fairly easily. That sequence right there proved how much of an advantage Blachowicz had at 205. Vettori just did not have the strength or size to keep Adesanya down. And as we all know, once Adesanya gets to the fence he is going to get up. It's just a matter of time. One thing I'm sure everyone picked up on was the head outside single that Vettori would shoot to put Adesanya against the cage and then would attempt to lock his hands. Next, he would eat about 6 or 7 elbows to the head, let go of the shot and clinch, and then they would separate. This specifically was just flat out embarrassing to see from Vettori, just absolutely zero awareness and fight IQ. Once again Vettori's shots were just slow and lacked anything super impressive, Adesanya is just a higher caliber fighter and this fight showed that pretty clearly. On the ground Vettori isn’t a super high level grappler either. Neither is Adesanya for that matter but even on the few times Vettori got him down he was rarely able to get past Adesanya's guard.  Now of course he was able to once, early on in the third. Vettori manages to get to half guard at 1:00 of the 3rd and begins to work on shoulder pressure, something Blachowicz was able to utilize effectively back in March. Now at 1:15 Adesanya times his hip escape very well just as Marvin is looking to advance further and it able to roll Marvin onto his side and get out from under. But, Marvin does some excellent work with his legs to find both hooks as Izzy Is getting up. This was probably some of Marvin's best work in the fight. He begins to fight for the RNC and while it does seem pretty close I feel that Marvin got a little bit too excited and overcommitted too much. He pays no attention to the lower half of Adesanya and before he even has a good grip on the choke (contrary to Rogan's belief that he was under the chin) he squeezes with everything he's got. Adesanya pops his head out and turns to find himself in Vettori's guard. There were absolutely some positives for Vettori in this sequence but it really struck me as an ""immature"" grappling exchange for him. Vettori attacked the ""submission"" before securing the position in this sequence. A more mature grappler would have attempted to lock on a body triangle especially because it was right there for him to take. With a body triangle the RNC becomes much easier to attack and the chances of a reversal drop dramatically (Michael Chandler wizardry withstanding). 

	

**Adesanya Striking Habits:**

	Adesanya was very hip feint heavy in this fight, as he often is. However his shoulder/arm feints were noticeably muted, especially in comparison to the Whittaker fight. Adesanya kept trying this odd combination out of southpaw, a straight rear hand followed by a weird lead hook/uppercut. It looks pretty awkward and never really landed to my knowledge. I'm curious as to why but in my mind it's entirely possible that Adesanya started seeing Vettori as more of a punching bag than an actual threat. Adesanya rarely single feints with his rear leg. Almost anytime he hip feints with it, it gets doubled or tripled up. Adesanya spent the majority of this fight in southpaw, but was almost exclusively in southpaw when along the cage. This is EXACTLY what he did against Paulo Costa last year (credit to Luke Thomas for pointing this out in his YT video last September). He is only ever orthodox in this center of the octagon and even then I'd estimate that he is only orthodox 50% of the time in the center. This seems to be Adesanya's most obvious and common pattern but I am not sure as to how it could be exploited without elite cage cutting skills, something Paulo Costa was supposed to have. Almost all of Adesanya's calf kicks came from southpaw, most likely because Vettori is a southpaw but it's worth noting. Also worth noting is that this was another area where Vettori's only adjustment was biting down on his mouthpiece. Izzy's kicking game was pretty structured and basic in this fight, basic by his standards that is. His lead leg was almost exclusively for leg kicks while the rear leg was almost exclusively used for body and head kicks. Izzy attacked the head kick early and often but his use of it tapered off quite a bit in the later rounds as Izzy in general began to coast to an easy 50-45. I wanted to touch again on that weird (shovelhook?) from Izzy. He picked up its usage in the 4th and 5th and it just looked super awkward for him so I'm not sure what he was trying to do with it. Adesanya really seems to be liking the right body/head kick with a left calf kick right behind it. That combo really did work for him and to my knowledge was a new weapon from his arsenal. Izzy just spams that rear left, right shovel hook combo constantly and misses nearly every time. I'm very curious why he kept going back to it.

	

**Looking Ahead:**

*Marvin Vettori:*

In what was overall a pretty disappointing performance from the young Italian there aren't too many positives to take away from this. Usually when the best thing we can talk about for a fighter is their durability you know that they got their ass beat for an extended period of time, and this fight was no exception to that. But that was likely the last time we will ever see Vettori and Adesanya in the octagon together again. Vettori has a lot to work on but at only 28 I doubt that this is the last time we will see him in a UFC title fight. With his kind of durability I would really like to see him try to develop into a legitimate submission threat and just get better takedowns (Improved speed and timing, heavy emphasis on speed). As it stands right now I just do not see Vettori as a championship caliber fighter. There is also a concern surrounding his coachability after seeing him between rounds during his fight but there is not much I can say about that. Looking ahead I would like to see him against either the loser of Till/Brunson or Gastelum/Cannonier sometime before this year ends. He certainly has a bright future but there is undoubtedly several areas that need work. 

	

*Israel Adesanya:*

The Last Stylebender returned to peak form with a dominant victory that in my opinion did not need to happen just yet. Vettori really did not challenge him in any serious way, allowing Adesanya to win with his basic tools. Many may be upset with Adesanya for not delivering a highlight reel KO like he did back in September but he really did not need to. Costa was a legitimate finishing threat, no matter how the fight had been going up till that point, and you could tell that Izzy respected that before and during the fight. Vettori posed no such threat and as such Adesanya could just touch him up and dance around him. Vettori is also incredibly difficult to finish him and there was really no reason to so Izzy took the easy road, because why would he do anything else? Leg kicks continued to be a major part of Izzy's offense and they are going to need to start being checked because until they are it's basically a free points button for him. With all that said, it's going to take an extremely elite fighter to beat Adesanya at 185. And Adesanya's next fight is almost guaranteed to be just that. All signs point towards a rematch with Robert Whittaker in Auckland likely in October. As far as I am concerned this is the only fight to make for the 185 strap and barring some sort of injury I don’t see anything else happening (However, I will never doubt the power of tomato fuckery again). I expect it to be a closer fight than the first instance but I still don’t see Izzy losing at 185 for the next few years.

Vettori Gameplan &amp; Adjustments:
	Vettori's gameplan coming into this fight had to look very similar to the 3rd round of his first bout with Adesanya and the 4th and 5th rounds of Blachowicz's, get Adesanya to the ground, flatten him out, and control him there while landing enough ground and pound to avoid a stand up. I don’t know what Vettori was thinking but he clearly just could not execute that plan at all. One of the most drastic differences I noticed in this fight was the speed difference between Adesanya and Vettori, Vettori just moves extremely slow in every department compared to Adesanya. On top of this, he doesn't even compensate with exceptional strength. Going off what we saw in the fight, moments like when Adesanya was able to use an overhook and just brutishly turn Marvin around and escape suggest that he may not have even been the strongest man in the cage. And you can see how big of an advantage this is for Adesanya when Vettori shoots. Izzy can go from his natural striking stance (feet even, weight leaned somewhat backwards), to an excellent wrestling stance (hips squared, weight low, and hands outstretched) before Marvin can even make contact. On one particularly sad shot in I believe the 4th, Adesanya has double wrist control as soon as Vettori touches him because he had ample time to get in a perfect stance and prepare for the stance. This was the shot where Adesanya was clowning on him by slapping his butt. And it's no surprise because Marvin just kept doing this OVER and OVER. It's no wonder Izzy just got more and more comfortable in the octagon as the fight went on. Based on how angry Marvin's coach, Raphael Cordeiro, was in the corner between rounds it seems possible that Vettori was not following the gameplan his team had laid out for him or was not making any of the adjustments asked of him. I personally tend to believe the latter since it was painfully obvious that Vettori was just doing the same thing over and over. Even in the 5th round, which will likely be the last time we will ever see him in the ring with Izzy he showed nothing new, just meaningless takedown attempts, incredible durability, and some functional striking. Which brings us to our next point, Vettori's headhunting. Vettori seemed to forget that Adesanya is an incredible striker, and was just winging punches at his head for the entirety of the stand up. He almost never threw a strike to the body and displayed a kicking game reminiscent of Kyle Bochniak. He made no attempts to change anything up, save for a few half decent leg kicks. 
	
Striking Observations:
	The striking went about as we all expected it to, a complete outclassing by Adesanya. The footwork was really interesting to watch, especially as someone who is just learning how important footwork is and the basics of it all. Adesanya constantly seemed to be dictating where the fight was held, whether that be in the center of the octagon or along the cage wall. Now while it seems quite ill-advised to want the fight near the edge of the cage one idea I can think of was that Adesanya did not want to risk being taken down in open space. As we all know, Adesanya's takedown defense along the cage is exceptional, while in open space it is significantly more suspect. Izzy may have felt that he had such an advantage striking that he could beat Marvin with his back to the cage, which he did. Vettori honestly made a respectable showing of himself on the feet. He showcased a functional jab that he landed fairly often and attempted cage cutting, a clear step up from Adesanya's last title contender, Paulo Costa. Adesanya's inhuman ability to lean backwards to an extreme degree while maintaining his balance showed itself in this fight again, albeit in a much more muted capacity due to the positioning of the fight. Vettori was clearly frustrated by this, which often resulted in him simply bull rushing Adesanya. Who then simply circled around and reset back in the center or wherever he chose to. This pattern actually repeats itself rather frequently: Both in southpaw, Marvin throws a 1-2, Adesanya simply leans back with little foot movement, Vettori charges forward continuing to throw 1-2s, Adesanya circles around and they reengage. Adesanya's head movement in this fight would have made Edmond Tarverdyan proud, although this was likely a product of Vettori's slowness and telegraphed strikes. Also of note, Adesanya frequently circled to Vettori's power side, showing his (righteous) lack of respect for Vettori's power and striking ability. Adesanya used a rear leg feint/kick from orthodox to transition to a rear leg calf kick from southpaw over and over. Vettori just never seems to pick up on it, got hit with it more and more as the fight went on. Adesanya really picked it up in the 3rd round, landing his most strikes and showing some beautiful ground work with the reversals and RNC defense. Izzy really started to pick up the calf kicks in the third, even scoring a knockdown with one. Vettori's mobility for the rest of the fight was clearly affected by it. Despite the fact that Adesanya was against the cage for most of this fight we actually were able to see a nice display of cage cutting ability from Adesanya. He uses his stance switching to create some very interesting angles that he used to herd Vettori. 
	
Wrestling/Ground Game:
	The time on the ground started off fairly well for Vettori but once again he just couldn't get the fight there enough. That opening takedown was beautifully timed from Vettori and gave me some initial hope, but Adesanya was able to get his butt right on over to the cage and get up fairly easily. That sequence right there proved how much of an advantage Blachowicz had at 205. Vettori just did not have the strength or size to keep Adesanya down. And as we all know, once Adesanya gets to the fence he is going to get up. It's just a matter of time. One thing I'm sure everyone picked up on was the head outside single that Vettori would shoot to put Adesanya against the cage and then would attempt to lock his hands. Next, he would eat about 6 or 7 elbows to the head, let go of the shot and clinch, and then they would separate. This specifically was just flat out embarrassing to see from Vettori, just absolutely zero awareness and fight IQ. Once again Vettori's shots were just slow and lacked anything super impressive, Adesanya is just a higher caliber fighter and this fight showed that pretty clearly. On the ground Vettori isn’t a super high level grappler either. Neither is Adesanya for that matter but even on the few times Vettori got him down he was rarely able to get past Adesanya's guard.  Now of course he was able to once, early on in the third. Vettori manages to get to half guard at 1:00 of the 3rd and begins to work on shoulder pressure, something Blachowicz was able to utilize effectively back in March. Now at 1:15 Adesanya times his hip escape very well just as Marvin is looking to advance further and it able to roll Marvin onto his side and get out from under. But, Marvin does some excellent work with his legs to find both hooks as Izzy Is getting up. This was probably some of Marvin's best work in the fight. He begins to fight for the RNC and while it does seem pretty close I feel that Marvin got a little bit too excited and overcommitted too much. He pays no attention to the lower half of Adesanya and before he even has a good grip on the choke (contrary to Rogan's belief that he was under the chin) he squeezes with everything he's got. Adesanya pops his head out and turns to find himself in Vettori's guard. There were absolutely some positives for Vettori in this sequence but it really struck me as an ""immature"" grappling exchange for him. Vettori attacked the ""submission"" before securing the position in this sequence. A more mature grappler would have attempted to lock on a body triangle especially because it was right there for him to take. With a body triangle the RNC becomes much easier to attack and the chances of a reversal drop dramatically (Michael Chandler wizardry withstanding). 
	
Adesanya Striking Habits:
	Adesanya was very hip feint heavy in this fight, as he often is. However his shoulder/arm feints were noticeably muted, especially in comparison to the Whittaker fight. Adesanya kept trying this odd combination out of southpaw, a straight rear hand followed by a weird lead hook/uppercut. It looks pretty awkward and never really landed to my knowledge. I'm curious as to why but in my mind it's entirely possible that Adesanya started seeing Vettori as more of a punching bag than an actual threat. Adesanya rarely single feints with his rear leg. Almost anytime he hip feints with it, it gets doubled or tripled up. Adesanya spent the majority of this fight in southpaw, but was almost exclusively in southpaw when along the cage. This is EXACTLY what he did against Paulo Costa last year (credit to Luke Thomas for pointing this out in his YT video last September). He is only ever orthodox in this center of the octagon and even then I'd estimate that he is only orthodox 50% of the time in the center. This seems to be Adesanya's most obvious and common pattern but I am not sure as to how it could be exploited without elite cage cutting skills, something Paulo Costa was supposed to have. Almost all of Adesanya's calf kicks came from southpaw, most likely because Vettori is a southpaw but it's worth noting. Also worth noting is that this was another area where Vettori's only adjustment was biting down on his mouthpiece. Izzy's kicking game was pretty structured and basic in this fight, basic by his standards that is. His lead leg was almost exclusively for leg kicks while the rear leg was almost exclusively used for body and head kicks. Izzy attacked the head kick early and often but his use of it tapered off quite a bit in the later rounds as Izzy in general began to coast to an easy 50-45. I wanted to touch again on that weird (shovelhook?) from Izzy. He picked up its usage in the 4th and 5th and it just looked super awkward for him so I'm not sure what he was trying to do with it. Adesanya really seems to be liking the right body/head kick with a left calf kick right behind it. That combo really did work for him and to my knowledge was a new weapon from his arsenal. Izzy just spams that rear left, right shovel hook combo constantly and misses nearly every time. I'm very curious why he kept going back to it.
	
Looking Ahead:
	
	Marvin Vettori:
	In what was overall a pretty disappointing performance from the young Italian there aren't too many positives to take away from this. Usually when the best thing we can talk about for a fighter is their durability you know that they got their ass beat for an extended period of time, and this fight was no exception to that. But that was likely the last time we will ever see Vettori and Adesanya in the octagon together again. Vettori has a lot to work on but at only 28 I doubt that this is the last time we will see him in a UFC title fight. With his kind of durability I would really like to see him try to develop into a legitimate submission threat and just get better takedowns (Improved speed and timing, heavy emphasis on speed). As it stands right now I just do not see Vettori as a championship caliber fighter. There is also a concern surrounding his coachability after seeing him between rounds during his fight but there is not much I can say about that. Looking ahead I would like to see him against either the loser of Till/Brunson or Gastelum/Cannonier sometime before this year ends. He certainly has a bright future but there is undoubtedly several areas that need work. 
	
	Israel Adesanya:
	The Last Stylebender returned to peak form with a dominant victory that in my opinion did not need to happen just yet. Vettori really did not challenge him in any serious way, allowing Adesanya to win with his basic tools. Many may be upset with Adesanya for not delivering a highlight reel KO like he did back in September but he really did not need to. Costa was a legitimate finishing threat, no matter how the fight had been going up till that point, and you could tell that Izzy respected that before and during the fight. Vettori posed no such threat and as such Adesanya could just touch him up and dance around him. Vettori is also incredibly difficult to finish him and there was really no reason to so Izzy took the easy road, because why would he do anything else? Leg kicks continued to be a major part of Izzy's offense and they are going to need to start being checked because until they are it's basically a free points button for him. With all that said, it's going to take an extremely elite fighter to beat Adesanya at 185. And Adesanya's next fight is almost guaranteed to be just that. All signs point towards a rematch with Robert Whittaker in Auckland likely in October. As far as I am concerned this is the only fight to make for the 185 strap and barring some sort of injury I don’t see anything else happening (However, I will never doubt the power of tomato fuckery again). I expect it to be a closer fight than the first instance but I still don’t see Izzy losing at 185 for the next few years.

In what was overall a pretty disappointing performance from the young Italian there aren't too many positives to take away from this. Usually when the best thing we can talk about for a fighter is their durability you know that they got their ass beat for an extended period of time, and this fight was no exception to that. But that was likely the last time we will ever see Vettori and Adesanya in the octagon together again.

I expect it to be a closer fight than the first instance but I still don’t see Izzy losing at 185 for the next few years.

Amanda Nunes vs Julianna Pena

- Usman 

- Adesanya 

- Ngannou 

- Moreno

- Rose “HD” Namajunas 

New Champ:

- Petr Yan 

- Most are gonna pick Jan over Glover and I agree. But this time next year I could see a new LHW champ. 

I really have no idea: 

The LW and Featherweight titles. Charles vs Dustin/Conor winner probably. Volk/Ortega and Max waiting

Custom flairs: here are three ways to obtain a custom flair:

* place and lose a flair bet in the Friday thread
* write a haiku
* draw a MS Paint-style image for the sub

The rules for the drawing or haiku are simply that it must be a ridiculous MMA-related scenario. If you would like a custom flair, send a message to us with a link to your drawing and your flair request. We'll probably grant it.

However, during his time in the UFC, his style featured a dearth of wrestling, instead relying on his patented Cuban missile punches and an awkward, idiosyncratic style of engaging and disengaging punching exchanges. While he did wrestle heavily in some specific fights throughout his career (taking down Whittaker 7 times throughout their 2 fights, and pouring in a ridiculous 7 takedowns in a single fight against Brad Tavares), it was far from his main weapon and was used more as a complimentary option against heavy strikers.

So, realistically, if Yoel had instituted a more wrestle heavy gameplan, perhaps akin to Daniel Cormier or Cain Velasquez (among many others of course), would he have been more or less successful? 

I personally believe heavy Yoel ground and pound is one of the scariest things I can conceive. A guy like Yoel with the body to wrestlefuck anyone in the division who also has the ability to absolutely nuke you in the face if you manage to somehow stave off all of his takedowns has gotta be one of the scariest possible fighters of all time in my view.

And then further consider if he had come into MMA with this gameplan, and also entered into the sport 10 years earlier? Could he have been one of the greatest fighters the UFC had ever seen? That one is a bit wilder but I also think it would've been a distinct possibility.",How successful (More? Less?) Would Yoel Romero have been if he had relied more on his wrestling?,41,1

It hurts the fighters and the fans and might be one of the worst parts of the sport. At this point most fighters aren't cutting for a size advantage, they're cutting not to have a massive disadvantage. The average person would feel like shit dehydrating themselves by 10 lbs, yet that's considered a small and ""healthy"" cut in mma.

That being PRIDE FC (my favorite MMA org) was the biggest stage for MMA until 2007 and to this day it has a special, unique atmosphere that IMO cannot be replicated again. (Also has rewatch value not even the UFC has IMHO)
That being said fans and fighters alike acknowledge the impact JMMA specially PRIDE FC itself had on the growth of MMA in both skill and popularity.
RIZIN will never beat out the UFC in brand recognition worldwide but I believe RIZIN could be a recognized brand among casual viewers as a transitional stage to the UFC if they decide to work heavily with either UFC or Bellator.
Put talent through the pressure cooker so to speak on a big stage with a lot on the line while not getting thrown to the wolves too early in the UFC.
RIZIN is the closest anyone will get to PRIDE FC's unique style of pageantry and presentation.
UFC prelim lvl fighters, Bellator vs RIZIN matches should be a regular and will get more eyes on them.
If they could get Alex pereira and build/hype him up with future bout against Israel Adesanya that would be epic.

TL:DR version:  RIZIN should be to the UFC what NXT is to WWE or keep working with Bellator heavily and share talent. Either way it would improve the talent in japan by exposing them to more international talent which is RIZIN's goal to begin with.",can RIZIN capture some half of PRIDE's magic?,0,1

I fully remembered everything that happened even right after the shot, and I was fully aware of what he it me with. my first thought was holy shit that was a Yair style ducking spinning elbow, that was fucking beautiful and my second thought was owch that was insanely hard, I was flly aware of my surrounding and everything, I just saw black for a second (I think because I closed my eyes, which i sometimes do when a shot is coming towards me) and dropped to a knee, then got up immediately. The first thing I did was say, that was really fucking hard, then I started moving about the ring shadowboxing and checking my balance and coordination was fine, and it felt completely fine. I even did another half an hour of sparring despite the fact that my nose was killing me, and actually felt better/,ore alert and awake than I had before the elbow. MY speech was similarly fine. I think I only fell down due to the fact that I was slightly off balance because I stepped into the elbow, and because of the shock of being hot that hard, as that was probably the hardest shot I have ever been hit by, by a long way. I didn't feel rocked at all, and got up did some shadowboxing and continued sparring. Anyways, do you guys think this was a knockdown/wobbled? And have you guys ever been knocked down, if so, what did it feel like. If I wasn't dropped, I must have a granite chin lol because that was a full force spinning elbow from my 18 year old brother who is 4 years older and considerably bigger which i completely stepped into and landed as cleanly as possible. If I did get dropped I must have insane recovery and toughness lol. Also if you don't think I was dropped, why do you think I fell over, do you agree wit my explanation? For context I have never been dropped. Also I think my nose is broken XD I also took a couple of flush shots to the nose after and still continued sparring :D, Also we were not wearing headgear. Thanks for reading guys, this is always an interesting topic, all replies are appreciated :D Thanks!!

You may have heard from him from those non-stop commercials about his life story in between fights. 

This time I decided only to calculate the average win percentage of opponents Sakuraba fought at the time of the fight. Instead of calculating their win percentage since, I thought I'd gather the time total of the fight find the average per fight, as well as per wins and losses by KO, Sub, and Decision to see what patterns might emerge. 

Sakuraba's opponents had a combined **549-180-29 (.724)** record when they fought him. 

The opponents he defeated had a win percentage of **264-120-17 (.658)**. Opponents he beat by knockout had a win percentage of **60-18-5 (.722)**, submissions had **194-100-12 (.637)** and decisions were **10-2 (.833)**. For his losses total win percentage was **282-59-11 (.801)**, KOs were **179-28-5 (.844)**, submissions were **39-9 (.812)** and decisions were **64-22-6 (.695)**.

His career lasted a total of **29,457** seconds which is **490.95** minutes, or **8.1825** hours. Averaged out across his career that's **12.66** minutes per win. He averaged **27.01** minutes per win by KO (thanks in large part to that legendary 90 minute bout against Royce Gracie) and **9.26** minutes per win by submission. His losses averaged out to **7.75** minutes apiece with an average of **6.76** minutes per KO and **3.06** minutes per submission.

So I’ve been going to an MMA class and I decided to hit the heavy bag and my knuckles got a little bloody. Nothing painful or anything.

But the issue I have now is that I’m sorta in a vicious circle where my knuckles start to scab over, then I go to training, and they start bleeding again.

Been doing this for a couple months now.

Like I said, there’s no real pain so I’ve lived with it but I don’t want any long term issues with my hands?

Maybe I’m just being paranoid but do you think its worth taking a couple weeks off to let them heal fully…

Anyway finally a few weeks ago I decided was time to dust off the gloves… I honestly forgot how much I missed punching and kicking things, now many years ago I was a member of this MMA gym but usually only a few fighters made it through the coach wasn’t great but determination allowed me to go undefeated for 7 fights. Got promised all these contracts etc nothing came of it. 

Fast forward to now, I showed face in my old gym a few weeks ago as was testing the water to see if it had advanced in the time I’ve been gone, saw the head coach (pretty sure he’s now a fraud or always was) I decided to take his word on things and signed up for the monthly’s including classes &amp; gym all in. I basically joined this place for the classes to save me having to get a PT (have always struggled to motivate myself on my own) I’ve been here 3 weeks, I have a time table of all the class times, have been in at least 10 times for a class and nobody has showed up to take the class. The gym is supposed to be 24/7 &amp; include the classes for the monthly price even says so when I signed the contract for 12 months. 

My advice here is;

Do I have some form of way to get out of this contract as I want to join a different gym as I legit only wanted the classes which I’m not getting. 

The false advertising of the opening times / classes for the monthly is probably conning a lot of people. 

Where do I stand here? I have tried speaking to him and everytime he gives a different excuse.

It's felt like casuals, commentators in the booth, and even more adamant fans have been treating them as some kind of cheat code a fighter can spam to all but guarantee victory. So, I decided to see if I could find any correlation between the use of leg kicks and winning in the Octagon.

Including Poirier vs McGregor II there have been 20 events since Poirier's win, so I examined half of them Gane vs Volkov - Whittaker vs Gastelum, to see how many leg kicks the winners and losers threw and landed, as well as their accuracy. I tallied these numbers for the entire events, then tallied a total for all of the events, and broke them all down by wins and losses by KO, Submission, and Decision.

The results are fairly interesting. For victories, total leg kicks thrown was **953** and total landed was **824** for an accuracy of **86.4%**. For losses, volume was **981**, kicks landed was **819**, and accuracy was **83.4%**. So, not a huge discrepancy, though winners were more accurate.

Some interesting findings were that fighters who lost by submission were noticeably more active when it came to throwing leg kicks, having thrown **70** and landing **61** for an accuracy of **87.1%** vs fighters who won by submission who threw **47** and landed **43** for an accuracy of **91.4%**. Perhaps this set them up to be taken down and submitted by talented grapplers?

Conversely, fighters who won by KO were **6.6%** more accurate with their leg kicks, hitting **107** out of **118** for an accuracy of **90.6%** vs their opponents who landed **95** out of **113** for an accuracy of **84%**, which feeds into the notion leg kicks are an important part of setting up KOs, which coincides with the narrative about Dustin Poirier's victory over Conor McGregor.

I decided to look up the number of title fights per year, division and in regards to the number of PPVs.

TL:DR: If Ngannou only fought once, it wouldn't be out of the ordinary. If he fights twice that's better than average. Thus far in 2021 we're on par with previous years in terms of title fights and PPVs / events.

----

Looks like the average of title fights per total event has stayed more or less the same, but the number of title fights per PPV has increased somewhat (since they started doing fewer PPVs and more other events). 

For most years there's two or less title fights per division with 2008, 2013, 2015 and 2016 being the exceptions when there were more than two title fights per division 

It was a lot more common in the past to have PPVs that wasn't headlined by title fights (And that's despite McGregor headlining a few PPVs without fighting for a title, twice in 2016, once in 2020, once in 2021).

-----

Interim titles counted. 

If it was intended/marketed to be a title fight, but one of the fighters missed weight, I've still included it:

Including Joseph Benavidez vs. Deiveson Figueired 1, Figueired missed weight.

Including two titles fights at MW in 2018, two weight misses by Romero (Yoel Romero vs. Luke Rockhold and Yoel Romero vs. Robert Whittaker)

Not including Daniel Cormier vs. Anderson Silva on UFC 200 in 2016 (Jon Jones was pulled from the event on three days notice).

-----

Featherweight, Bantamweight added in 2010.

Flyweight, Women's Bantamweight added in 2012.

Women's Strawweight added in 2014.

Women's Featherweight, Women's Flyweight added in 2017.

-----

I can't guarantee that all the numbers are correct.

The data mainly comes from wikipedia, primarily:

[List of UFC champions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_champions), some fights aren't listed there, but I've tried to make sure I included the ones that were missing.

[List of UFC events](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_UFC_events)

(Given that the inaugural titles / WEC title defense weren't held in the beginning of a year, the fights / division could be a bit misleading for the years when a new division was added).

2008 seemed as good of a start year as any with the end of Pride in the previous year.
